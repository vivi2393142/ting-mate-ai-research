## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe what a normal day looks like for you?</summary>

I wake up around 6 in the morning, make myself some breakfast, and brew a pot of tea. I like to sit and watch TV—usually the news or one of those old shows. I'll wash the dishes, maybe do a bit of laundry, and just keep to myself most of the day.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does anyone help you with your daily routine? If so, how do they assist you?</summary>

No, I manage fine. I don't need help. Though Mrs. Chang—my daughter-in-law—she cooks sometimes. But I can get by on my own.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you use anything to help you remember things, like notes, alarms, or reminders from people?</summary>

No need for all that. I remember what I need to. If something's really important, someone will remind me, I suppose.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What things do you forget most often?</summary>

I don't think I forget that much. Maybe what day it is sometimes... but who doesn't?

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>Are there times when forgetting something causes problems or stress for you?</summary>

Not really. Things are quiet around here. Nothing urgent going on.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you sometimes feel confused or unsure about what's happening during the day?</summary>

No, I know what's going on. If something seems off, I just take my time and it comes back to me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When you forget something, how do you usually handle it?</summary>

I don't panic. I sit down, think it through. Or I might just let it go—it usually comes back later.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you use a smartphone or tablet? What do you use it for?</summary>

I use my phone to call my daughter or leave her those voice messages. That's about it. Don't need all those apps and gadgets.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever used any apps to remind you of things?</summary>

No, I haven't. I don't really use apps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When using apps, what makes them easy or difficult for you?</summary>

I don't use them enough to say. Too many buttons or screens—that's no good.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When texting or using app, you prefer to use voice control or touch control?</summary>

I like leaving voice messages. Touch screens are hard to deal with. My fingers don't always hit the right spot.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you want from your daily life?</summary>

Just peace and quiet. Maybe someone to check in once in a while, that's fine.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you not want?</summary>

I don't want anyone fussing over me or hovering. I can take care of myself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there tasks you prefer to do on your own? What tasks would you rather someone help you with?</summary>

I like doing my dishes, laundry—I manage fine. I guess I don't mind if someone else cooks sometimes, as long as they don't try to feed me like a baby.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it be helpful to have gentle reminders for important things, like meals or medicine?</summary>

Maybe. If it was really gentle and didn't talk at me like a nurse. But I don't need a machine telling me how to live.

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What do you think about this kind of app?</summary>

Sounds like it could be helpful for some folks. Not sure I'd need it myself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would you like to try using something like this?</summary>

Maybe... if it's simple. And I don't have to tap through too many screens.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What would you want this app to do for you?</summary>

Maybe tell me if I've already eaten or when someone's coming to visit. Just things that are useful, not too much.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

I don't want it bothering me all the time. And I don't want to have to fiddle with it to make it work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

Well, if I were going to use one of these apps—which I don't think I need, but just for the sake of answering your question—I'd only want a few simple and useful tasks set on it. Nothing fancy. Just the basics.

Here's what I might set on the App

- Tea Reminder – 6:30 AM

  - Just a little nudge in case I forget to put the kettle on. Though I usually don't.

- Take a walk – Around 10:00 AM or 3:00 PM

  - Something quiet, just to get outside a bit. The fresh air is good.

- Check if I've eaten lunch – 12:30 PM

  - Sometimes I forget if I already ate or not. A reminder could help without bothering me.

- Talk to my daughter – 5:00 PM

  - I like to call her most days. Could be helpful if I forget the time.

- Medicine (if I ever need it)
  - I don't take any right now, but if they ever make me take something, fine—one reminder only.
