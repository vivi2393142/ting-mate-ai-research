## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe your daily caregiving routine?</summary>

My mornings start with making sure Jane takes her medication, eats breakfast, and is settled before I leave for work. I prep lunch for her and leave reminders. After work, I manage dinner, review her day, help with meds again, and ensure she's relaxed before bed. Weekends are more hands-on: gardening together, errands, and checking in on any health or mood changes.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you help the person you care for remember things, like medicine or appointments?</summary>

I use sticky notes, phone alarms, and visual cues around the house. I often text or call her during the day to remind her about medications or check how she's doing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are other family members involved in caregiving? If so, how do you coordinate?</summary>

Our son visits about once a month. He helps with tech support—setting up phone reminders or explaining apps—but he's not involved in day-to-day care. There's no formal coordination, but I update him now and then.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>What are the most difficult parts of your caregiving role?</summary>

The emotional strain of seeing Jane's changes and juggling everything—work, home, and her care—is overwhelming. It's lonely too, not having a real break or time for myself.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there times when you feel anxious about their safety or well-being?</summary>

Absolutely. Even with routines, I worry if she's okay when I'm at work—if she forgot to eat or take her meds, or if she wandered outside or got confused.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do memory problems affect your own schedule or energy?</summary>

Repeating myself constantly wears me down. I often feel mentally drained and have little energy left for anything else after work and caregiving duties.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you or your family member use phones or apps for health or reminders?</summary>

I use my phone to set reminders and calendar alerts. Jane uses basic phone functions—texts, calls, and Facebook—but she doesn't initiate reminders or use new apps unless I set them up.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tech have you tried (if any) to assist with care?</summary>

We've tried Google Calendar, basic alarms, and a shared grocery list app. I've looked into memory aid apps but haven't committed to one yet.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes a digital tool easy or hard for you and them to use?</summary>

Easy tools are visual, simple, and don't need frequent updates. Hard ones require too many steps or have cluttered interfaces. Jane gets overwhelmed by anything not intuitive.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>In what areas do you wish you had more support as a caregiver?</summary>

I need emotional support and better ways to monitor her well-being while I'm at work. Also, clearer routines for her that don't rely on me constantly checking in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it help if you could check in on their routine remotely?</summary>

That would be very helpful. Just knowing if she took meds or followed the routine would ease a lot of anxiety.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of features would make a memory-support app truly helpful for your situation?</summary>

Visual and audible reminders
A shared routine dashboard
Simple "check-in" buttons for Jane to tap
Alerts for me if she misses a task
Voice notes or picture-based prompts

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What features would be most useful to you personally?</summary>

Daily routine planner we can both see
Alerts if a task is missed
Easy reminders (especially voice or image-based)
Ability for me to update her routine remotely

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you feel about this kind of app?</summary>

I think it's a great idea—especially if it actually reduces my mental load. I'd be relieved to have a tool that lets me worry less when I'm not home.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there anything you'd be worried about using or setting up?</summary>

Setup might be tricky, especially making sure it works smoothly for Jane without confusing her. Too many features could overwhelm us.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

Yes, I'd definitely be willing to try it with Jane, especially if setup is simple and I can test things before handing it over to her.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

Here are the main tasks I would set up for Jane on the app, ideally broken down by time of day for consistency and ease of use:

### Morning

- **8:00 AM – Take morning medication** (with a visual cue of her pill bottle)
- **8:15 AM – Eat breakfast** (option to check off)
- **9:00 AM – Water plants or check the garden** (she enjoys this and sets a positive tone)
- **10:00 AM – Light chore** (e.g., wipe counters, fold laundry)

### Midday

- **12:00 PM – Eat lunch** (with a picture reminder of the lunch container)
- **12:30 PM – Text or call John to check-in** (simple tap task)
- **1:00 PM – Watch a favorite show or do a calming activity** (preset options like gardening, TV, or music)

### Afternoon

- **3:00 PM – Light snack reminder**
- **3:30 PM – Short walk or stretch** (with a motivational note)

### Evening

- **6:00 PM – Eat dinner** (I'll usually be home to help with this)
- **7:00 PM – Take evening medication**
- **8:00 PM – Relax with a TV show or wind-down time**
- **9:30 PM – Prepare for bed** (change, brush teeth, etc.)

### Other Recurring/Optional Tasks

#### Weekly:

- **Wednesday**: "Message a friend" reminder
- **Saturday**: "Check calendar with John"
- **Sunday**: "Video call with our son" (if planned)

#### Random/As-Needed:

- **"Check fridge for groceries"**
- **"Send a photo from the garden"** (fun engagement)

Each task would ideally have:

- A simple checkbox or tap-to-complete feature
- Visual icons or photos
- Optional audio reminders with my voice or a calming chime
