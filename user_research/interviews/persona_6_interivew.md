## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe your daily caregiving routine?</summary>

During the week, I check in with my father multiple times a day through phone calls and short voice messages. I ask how he's feeling, what he's eaten, and whether he's done basic things like making tea or turning off the stove. I visit him in person every weekend to assess how he's really doing and help with tasks that might be slipping through the cracks.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you help the person you care for remember things, like medicine or appointments?</summary>

Because he doesn't acknowledge his memory loss, I have to be subtle. I'll call before an appointment and say something like, "Just checking if you're still up for our plan today," rather than reminding him he forgot. I also try to leave visual cues when I visit — like writing on a calendar or leaving appointment notes near the TV or kettle.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are other family members involved in caregiving? If so, how do you coordinate?</summary>

Yes. My sister-in-law, Mrs. Chang, lives with him and manages his meals and basic safety around the house. We keep in touch over the phone or by text to coordinate visits or handle anything urgent. She handles the daily physical caregiving, and I provide emotional support and oversee bigger concerns, like appointments or changes in behavior.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>What are the most difficult parts of your caregiving role?</summary>

His stubbornness is the hardest part. He refuses to go to the doctor or admit anything is wrong, which limits what we can do. Also, the repetition in our conversations can be emotionally draining, though I try to stay patient.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there times when you feel anxious about their safety or well-being?</summary>

Yes — especially during the week when I'm not there. I worry he'll leave the stove on, fall, or not eat properly. His hearing loss adds to the concern, because if he doesn't hear something (like a knock or phone ring), he might miss help.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do memory problems affect your own schedule or energy?</summary>

They increase the time I spend checking in and second-guessing things. I'll often have to repeat conversations or drive out unexpectedly when something seems off. Emotionally, it's tiring to always be "on alert."

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you or your family member use phones or apps for health or reminders?</summary>

I do — I use my phone calendar and reminders to keep track of his appointments. He only uses his phone for voice calls and WhatsApp audio messages. That's it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tech have you tried (if any) to assist with care?</summary>

We haven't tried much, honestly. I've looked into some devices, but nothing feels usable for his level of tech comfort. Even something like a smart speaker is a stretch for him.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes a digital tool easy or hard for you and them to use?</summary>

For me: if it syncs across devices and gives me updates without needing too much input, it's helpful.
For him: if it's visual, automatic, and doesn't require tapping buttons or navigating menus. If there's too much complexity, he won't engage with it.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>In what areas do you wish you had more support as a caregiver?</summary>

Remote monitoring — knowing if he's eaten, taken his pills, or turned off the stove.
Emotional support or connection tools for him — he's isolated and doesn't socialize much.
A way to bridge communication when I'm not around, especially as his memory declines.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it help if you could check in on their routine remotely?</summary>

Absolutely. If I could see simple indicators — like when he made tea, watched TV, or moved around — I'd feel more confident leaving him alone during the week.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of features would make a memory-support app truly helpful for your situation?</summary>

Passive tracking (e.g., motion sensors or activity updates)
A way for me to send him gentle reminders that feel like "chat messages"
Shared schedules that I could update and he could see without much effort
Voice-based reminders that use my voice or a familiar tone
Alerts to me if he doesn't engage with something by a certain time

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What features would be most useful to you personally?</summary>

Voice-based alerts or messages I can record
Real-time activity updates
A shared dashboard for tracking meals, meds, or routines
A simple caregiver log I could update after visits

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you feel about this kind of app?</summary>

Hopeful — it sounds like something that could give me more peace of mind and reduce repetitive phone calls. But it has to be very, very simple for him or he won't use it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there anything you'd be worried about using or setting up?</summary>

Yes — the setup process. If it involves configuring multiple devices or teaching him something new, it might not work. I'd need to do everything on my end and have it run passively for him.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

Yes, if it's gentle and unobtrusive. I'd absolutely be open to testing something like this, especially if it helps me support him without making him feel "managed."

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

If I were using the memory-support app for my father, I'd set up simple, daily tasks that support his routine while respecting his independence and tech limitations. The goal would be to reinforce his sense of control while giving me quiet reassurance that he's okay.

### Morning Routine Tasks (6:00–9:00 a.m.)

- **"Did you make your tea?"**

  - **Time**: 6:30 a.m.
  - **Note**: A gentle voice reminder in my voice: "Morning, Baba. Did you make your tea yet?"
  - **Why**: He always makes tea, but this helps maintain routine and lets me know he's up.

- **"Have you eaten breakfast?"**
  - **Time**: 8:00 a.m.
  - **Note**: "Just checking — have you eaten anything this morning?"
  - **Why**: He sometimes forgets meals, and this opens the door for me to check in later.

### Daily Checkpoints

- **"Medication Check"** (if he were willing — currently not confirmed)

  - **Time**: 9:00 a.m. or whenever needed
  - **Note**: Light reminder in my voice: "Did you take your pills this morning?"
  - **Why**: Only if he agrees; currently he resists this, so I'd hold off until needed.

- **"Stretch or walk around?"**
  - **Time**: 11:30 a.m.
  - **Note**: "You've been sitting for a while — stretch your legs?"
  - **Why**: To break up his long TV sessions and reduce sitting fatigue.

### Afternoon Check (12:00–2:00 p.m.)

- **"Lunch check-in"**
  - **Time**: 1:00 p.m.
  - **Note**: "Did you eat yet? What did Mrs. Chang cook today?"
  - **Why**: Keeps him engaged and aware of the time without sounding like a demand.

### Evening Routine (5:00–8:00 p.m.)

- **"Start winding down?"**
  - **Time**: 7:30 p.m.
  - **Note**: "Time to wind down for the evening. Want to watch something relaxing?"
  - **Why**: Sets a calming tone and marks the end of his day, helpful for routine anchoring.

### What I won't set (yet)

- **Complex task lists**
- **Medication alarms** (he resists reminders)
- **Anything requiring him to "check off" or interact with buttons**
- **Multiple notifications** — too many would make him annoyed or suspicious
