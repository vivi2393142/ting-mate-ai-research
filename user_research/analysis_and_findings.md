# User Research – Analysis and Findings

This directory contains the analysis of GPT-simulated persona interviews conducted for the Ting Mate project.

The analysis used **thematic analysis** to identify recurring needs, concerns, and behaviors among memory-impaired personas and caregiver personas. A total of **35 unique codes** were identified and grouped into **10 overarching themes**.

The frequency of each code was calculated separately for the two persona groups to highlight differences and similarities in priorities.

The table below summarises the five most frequent codes for each persona group, with occurrence counts in parentheses.
