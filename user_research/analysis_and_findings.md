# User Research – Analysis and Findings

This directory contains the analysis of GPT-simulated persona interviews conducted for the Ting Mate project.

The analysis used **thematic analysis** to identify recurring needs, concerns, and behaviors among memory-impaired personas and caregiver personas. A total of **35 unique codes** were identified and grouped into **10 overarching themes**.

The frequency of each code was calculated separately for the two persona groups to highlight differences and similarities in priorities.

## Top Five Most Frequent Codes by Persona Group

The table below summarises the five most frequent codes for each persona group, with occurrence counts in parentheses.

| Memory-impaired personas                                  | Caregiver personas                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family support reliance (`FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE`, 33)   | Remote monitoring need (`REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED`, 27)           |
| Maintaining independence (`MAINTAINING_INDEPENDENCE`, 27) | Simplicity preference (`SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE`, 25)             |
| Medication reminders (`MEDICATION_REMINDERS`, 19)         | Caregiver dashboard (`CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD`, 25)                 |
| Simplicity preference (`SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE`, 18)       | Emotional exhaustion (`EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION`, 22)               |
| Daily routine forgetting (`DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING`, 17) | Gentle reminders preference (`GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE`, 21) |

## Theme Summary

Below is a brief description of each theme identified in the analysis:

1. **Technology Acceptance & Usability** – Preferences and barriers related to adopting and using technology.
2. **Memory Challenges & Cognitive Issues** – Specific types of memory-related difficulties affecting daily life.
3. **Independence & Dignity** – Desire to maintain self-sufficiency and avoid infantilisation.
4. **Gentle Interaction Preferences** – Preference for supportive, non-intrusive prompts and reminders.
5. **Caregiver Burden & Anxiety** – Emotional strain and stress experienced by caregivers.
6. **Family Coordination & Communication** – How families coordinate care and share information.
7. **Functional Requirements** – Specific functional needs such as task reminders or emergency contacts.
8. **Emotional & Social Needs** – Need for encouragement, social connection, and emotional reassurance.
9. **App-Specific Preferences** – Expectations about app setup, notifications, and privacy.
10. **Current Coping Strategies** – Methods currently used to manage memory challenges.

## Key Insights

- **Collaboration is central to care.** Families want a shared, lightweight way to see “what happened” and “what’s next” — e.g., synced task status, simple activity logs, and an at‑a‑glance overview for caregivers.
- **Support independence and control.** Participants prefer tools that help rather than monitor. Clear privacy choices (what is shared, with whom, and when) are essential to preserve dignity and autonomy.
- **Keep it simple and familiar.** Both groups favour minimal steps, predictable patterns, and UI conventions they already know. Short, contextual guidance works better than heavy tutorials.
- **Routines and medication are anchor use cases.** Daily task reminders and medication prompts are core needs for memory‑impaired users and reduce caregiver anxiety.
- **Tone matters for reassurance.** Encouraging, non‑judgmental microcopy and gentle reminders help users feel supported, not pressured.
- **Bridge to existing coping strategies.** Many memory‑impaired users already rely on physical aids (sticky notes, wall calendars). Designs that align with—or smoothly digitize—these habits can lower the learning curve.
