| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | No, I manage fine. I don't need help.                                                                                                                                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Though Mrs. Chang—my daughter-in-law—she cooks sometimes. But I can get by on my own.                                                                                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | No need for all that. I remember what I need to.                                                                                                                     | TECH_RESISTANCE                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | If something's really important, someone will remind me, I suppose.                                                                                                  | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Maybe what day it is sometimes... but who doesn't?                                                                                                                   | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Not really. Things are quiet around here. Nothing urgent going on.                                                                                                   | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | No, I know what's going on. If something seems off, I just take my time and it comes back to me.                                                                     | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I don't panic. I sit down, think it through. Or I might just let it go—it usually comes back later.                                                                  | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I use my phone to call my daughter or leave her those voice messages. That's about it.                                                                               | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Don't need all those apps and gadgets.                                                                                                                               | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | No, I haven't. I don't really use apps.                                                                                                                              | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I don't use them enough to say. Too many buttons or screens—that's no good.                                                                                          | TECH_RESISTANCE                | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I like leaving voice messages. Touch screens are hard to deal with. My fingers don't always hit the right spot.                                                      | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Just peace and quiet. Maybe someone to check in once in a while, that's fine.                                                                                        | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I don't want anyone fussing over me or hovering. I can take care of myself.                                                                                          | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I like doing my dishes, laundry—I manage fine.                                                                                                                       | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I guess I don't mind if someone else cooks sometimes, as long as they don't try to feed me like a baby.                                                              | ANTI_INFANTILIZATION           | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Maybe. If it was really gentle and didn't talk at me like a nurse.                                                                                                   | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | ANTI_INFANTILIZATION           |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | But I don't need a machine telling me how to live.                                                                                                                   | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Sounds like it could be helpful for some folks. Not sure I'd need it myself.                                                                                         | TECH_RESISTANCE                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Maybe... if it's simple. And I don't have to tap through too many screens.                                                                                           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Maybe tell me if I've already eaten or when someone's coming to visit. Just things that are useful, not too much.                                                    | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS       |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I don't want it bothering me all the time. And I don't want to have to fiddle with it to make it work.                                                               | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          | SETUP_SIMPLICITY            |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I'd only want a few simple and useful tasks set on it. Nothing fancy. Just the basics.                                                                               | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Tea Reminder – 6:30 AM. Just a little nudge in case I forget to put the kettle on. Though I usually don't.                                                           | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Take a walk – Around 10:00 AM or 3:00 PM. Something quiet, just to get outside a bit.                                                                                | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Check if I've eaten lunch – 12:30 PM. Sometimes I forget if I already ate or not.                                                                                    | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | A reminder could help without bothering me.                                                                                                                          | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Talk to my daughter – 5:00 PM. I like to call her most days. Could be helpful if I forget the time.                                                                  | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Medicine (if I ever need it). I don't take any right now, but if they ever make me take something, fine—one reminder only.                                           | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Most days are pretty quiet. I usually wake up when John does, and he helps me with breakfast and gives me my medication.                                             | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I might do a little gardening if the weather's nice, or watch a TV show.                                                                                             | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I sometimes message my friends or look at Facebook.                                                                                                                  | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | In the afternoon, I'll either rest, make something simple to eat, or wait for John to come home.                                                                     | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, John helps a lot. He makes sure I take my medication and keeps track of appointments and other things.                                                          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | He usually writes things down or sets reminders on his phone for me. He's very patient.                                                                              | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, sometimes I write notes, and John uses his phone to set alarms or reminders.                                                                                    | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | He also reminds me in person. I have a calendar too, but I forget to look at it.                                                                                     | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING    |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I forget what day it is, what I just talked about, or if I've eaten yet.                                                                                             | TIME_DISORIENTATION            | CONVERSATION_REPETITION        | MEAL_REMINDERS              |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Sometimes I forget if I've taken my medicine already, which worries me.                                                                                              | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, especially with medicine. I get nervous if I'm not sure whether I've taken it.                                                                                  | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I also get embarrassed if I repeat myself a lot when talking to people.                                                                                              | CONVERSATION_REPETITION        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, especially if the routine changes. If something unexpected happens or I can't remember a plan, I feel a bit lost or anxious.                                    | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I usually ask John. Sometimes I try to retrace my steps or check my phone or calendar, but I get frustrated if I can't figure it out.                                | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, I use my phone. I use it mostly for texting, calling, Facebook, and looking at photos.                                                                          | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | John has set some alarms or reminders, but I don't use reminder apps myself unless he sets them up for me.                                                           | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | SETUP_SIMPLICITY            |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | If it's simple and clear, I can use it. If there are too many steps or buttons, I get confused or give up.                                                           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I like when there are pictures or clear labels.                                                                                                                      | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I mostly use touch, but sometimes voice is easier if I remember how to use it. John helps me with that.                                                              | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I'd like reminders for medicine, meals, and maybe when I have plans.                                                                                                 | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | MEAL_REMINDERS                 |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I also appreciate when someone checks in on me if I seem off.                                                                                                        | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I don't want someone doing everything for me. I still like feeling useful.                                                                                           | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I like to water the plants, help with meals, and do little chores.                                                                                                   | CONTROL_DESIRE                 | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I prefer help with remembering things, managing appointments, or anything that needs a lot of steps.                                                                 | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, definitely. Especially if they're not too loud or annoying.                                                                                                     | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I think it sounds helpful, especially if it's easy to use.                                                                                                           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Yes, I'd be open to trying it, especially if John helps me set it up.                                                                                                | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Remind me gently when it's time to take my medicine or eat.                                                                                                          | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | MEAL_REMINDERS              |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Maybe even show what I have planned today.                                                                                                                           | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I'd also like a little checkmark or something when I've done something already, so I don't keep guessing.                                                            | TASK_CONFIRMATION              |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I'd worry that I might not remember how to use it. If it's too complicated, I might stop using it.                                                                   | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I'd want it to be simple, with big buttons or even voice reminders.

| Jane          | Carereceiver | Take morning medicine (maybe around 8 AM)                                                                                                                            | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Eat breakfast (right after meds)                                                                                                                                     | MEAL_REMINDERS                 |                                |                             |                       |

| Jane          | Carereceiver | Start getting ready for bed (like brushing teeth, maybe around 9 PM)                                                                                                 | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Did you take your medicine? check-in – something like a yes/no button                                                                                                | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       | TASK_CONFIRMATION              |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Today's events – something I can tap to see if I have visitors or plans                                                                                              | TIME_DISORIENTATION            | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Mark off completed tasks – like checking off that I ate or took my pills                                                                                             | TASK_CONFIRMATION              |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Water the plants (every 2–3 days)                                                                                                                                    | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Put laundry in (maybe once a week, with John reminding me too)                                                                                                       | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Tidy up kitchen (after meals, just a gentle nudge)                                                                                                                   | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Message a friend (once a week, just to stay connected)                                                                                                               | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Son visits? – if my son's coming soon, it could remind me that morning so I don't get caught off guard                                                               | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | A reminder to take a breath or rest if I'm feeling overwhelmed                                                                                                       | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             |                                |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Maybe a small journal or How are you feeling today? button, just with simple faces I could tap                                                                       | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | If it's easy to see and I can just tap things when they're done, I think that would really help.                                                                     | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TASK_CONFIRMATION              |                             |                       |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | And maybe John can set some of the reminders too so I don't have to remember to do that myself.                                                                      | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I make myself some tea, maybe a little toast or oatmeal.                                                                                                             | CONTROL_DESIRE                 | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I try to do a bit around the house—like tidying or sorting through the mail—but my body doesn't always cooperate.                                                    | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | By afternoon, I'm usually resting. I might try to cook something small for dinner, unless Ally gets home first.                                                      | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Yes, Ally helps with most things. She handles the groceries, the cooking when I can't, the cleaning—though I try to do my bit.                                       | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | She reminds me to take my medicine and checks the calendar for me.                                                                                                   | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | She even helps me when I get stuck using my phone.                                                                                                                   | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Sometimes I write things down. Sticky notes on the fridge, mostly.                                                                                                   | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Ally sets the timer or reminders on the phone for my pills.                                                                                                          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | MEDICATION_REMINDERS        |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And she tells me things more than once when I forget. She's patient—well, most days.                                                                                 | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I forget where I put things. Like the keys, or my purse, or the tea tin.                                                                                             | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And sometimes I forget what day it is or whether I've taken my medicine.                                                                                             | TIME_DISORIENTATION            | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And people's names... I forget those, even family.                                                                                                                   | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Oh yes. Especially when I misplace something important. Like the remote or my glasses.                                                                               | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Sometimes, yes. I'll sit there wondering what I'm supposed to be doing next, or I'll be halfway through something and completely lose track of why I started.        | TASK_INTERRUPTION_ISSUES       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Well, I try not to make a fuss. I sit quietly and try to remember, or I retrace my steps.                                                                            | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | If it's really bad, I ask Ally. But I hate doing that too much—it makes me feel... incapable.                                                                        | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I use my phone—mostly for calls, some texts, and I check Facebook.                                                                                                   | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I scroll through pictures of the grandkids or see what the cousins are up to.                                                                                        | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I think Ally's set some alarms for me before, but I don't know what app she used.                                                                                    | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't like when things are too small to read, or when the buttons are in strange places.                                                                           | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | If it's clear and big and doesn't have too many steps, then I can manage.                                                                                            | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | But if there are too many menus? Forget it.                                                                                                                          | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I use my finger most of the time, but if I could talk to it—like Remind me to take my pill—that'd be nice.                                                           | VOICE_PREFERENCE               |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | As long as it understands me. Sometimes those voice things don't.                                                                                                    | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Gentle reminders would be nice. Not pushy.                                                                                                                           | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Just something that pops up or says, Don't forget your medicine. Or Have you eaten?                                                                                  | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | MEAL_REMINDERS              |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And maybe something that helps me keep track of what I did today, so I don't feel so lost.                                                                           | TASK_CONFIRMATION              |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't want anyone treating me like I'm useless. I may be forgetful, but I can still think.                                                                         | ANTI_INFANTILIZATION           | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't want someone doing everything for me.                                                                                                                        | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I like to pick out my own clothes, make my tea, write my little lists. Things like that.                                                                             | CONTROL_DESIRE                 | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | But I need help lifting heavy things or getting down the stairs.                                                                                                     | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Yes, absolutely. But it has to be gentle—not nagging.                                                                                                                | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't like relying on Ally for every little thing.                                                                                                                 | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Yes, I'd try it—especially if it's simple to use and Ally helps set it up.                                                                                           | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Remind me about my medicine. Tell me when it's time to eat.                                                                                                          | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | MEAL_REMINDERS                 |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Help me remember appointments or family birthdays.                                                                                                                   | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And maybe keep a little list of what I've done each day so I can look back and feel less... forgetful.                                                               | TASK_CONFIRMATION              | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I'd worry it might be too complicated. Or that I'd mess something up by pressing the wrong button.                                                                   | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't want it to beep at me too much or stress me out.                                                                                                             | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And I'd want to know who can see what's in it—just me and Ally, hopefully.                                                                                           | PRIVACY_CONCERNS               |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Morning medicine – around 9:00 AM, after I've had my tea.                                                                                                            | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Afternoon water reminder – sometimes I forget to drink water unless someone tells me.                                                                                | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Evening medicine – maybe 8:00 PM or so, before I start winding down.                                                                                                 | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Check if I've eaten – just a gentle nudge around lunchtime and dinner. Something like, Have you had your lunch yet?                                                  | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Bathroom reminder – if I've been sitting too long, a gentle poke to move a bit or check in with my body.                                                             | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Grocery day with Ally – usually Saturday or Sunday. It could remind me the night before to get my shopping list ready.                                               | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Trash day – I never remember when the bins go out anymore. The app could say Put the bins out tonight.                                                               | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Laundry day – if Ally helps on certain days, I'd like to remember to gather my clothes or ask her for help.                                                          | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Sunday call with family – if we're trying to stay in touch more, that'd be nice to remember.                                                                         | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Doctor appointments – sometimes Ally books them, and I forget until we're already late.                                                                              | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Breathing treatment or puffers – not every day, but on the bad days when I need it, it could ask, How's your breathing today?                                        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | What did I do today? – A little note section that asks in the evening, Want to write down something from today? Might help me feel less lost.                        | TASK_CONFIRMATION              | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             |                             |                       |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Remind me where I put things – Like if Ally logs that I left the keys by the bread box, it can say, Your keys are by the bread box!                                  | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I usually start my day early with a walk with my dog. That helps me clear my head and get moving.                                                                    | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | After that, I do some light strength training or cardio. I try to keep my mornings structured.                                                                       | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I eat meals at regular times to keep things consistent.                                                                                                              | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I live independently, but I have a good support system.                                                                                                              | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | My sister checks in most days by text or call.                                                                                                                       | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Friends help by reminding me about events or appointments if I need a nudge.                                                                                         | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | They don't do things for me, just keep me on track when needed.                                                                                                      | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes, absolutely. I use my phone a lot—alarms, calendar reminders, and sticky notes around the house.                                                                 | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I also set timers when I cook or even when I start laundry, just in case I get distracted.                                                                           | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | TASK_INTERRUPTION_ISSUES       |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Names, appointments, sometimes even what I was just doing.                                                                                                           | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | It's frustrating when I walk into a room and forget why I went in there.                                                                                             | TASK_INTERRUPTION_ISSUES       |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I also sometimes forget conversations I had the day before.                                                                                                          | CONVERSATION_REPETITION        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes, especially when I miss something important—like a doctor's appointment—or when I repeat myself and realize it after.                                            | CONVERSATION_REPETITION        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes, that happens more when I'm tired or overwhelmed. I can lose track of the time or the order of things I was supposed to do.                                      | TIME_DISORIENTATION            | TASK_INTERRUPTION_ISSUES       |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I try to pause and breathe. If I'm with someone, I ask them to remind me.                                                                                            | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | If I'm alone, I'll check my phone or notes. Sometimes I just let it go if it's not that important.                                                                   | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes, I use both. My phone is my main tool—calendar, reminders, texting, taking pictures of things I want to remember, and even tracking my workouts.                 | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes. I use the calendar app, Google Keep for notes, and a medication reminder app.                                                                                   | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Simple is best. Big buttons, clear instructions.                                                                                                                     | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Too many options or too much text confuses me.                                                                                                                       | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I like when something walks me through a task, step-by-step.                                                                                                         | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I use both. Voice is helpful when I'm too tired to type, but sometimes it misunderstands me.                                                                         | VOICE_PREFERENCE               |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I like having both options.                                                                                                                                          | VOICE_PREFERENCE               |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I'd like help staying on top of appointments, meals, and remembering names.                                                                                          | MEAL_REMINDERS                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Encouragement helps too—those little "you're doing great" nudges.                                                                                                    | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I don't want people doing everything for me. I need to feel independent.                                                                                             | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I'd rather have tools that support me, not take over.                                                                                                                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I like doing my own meals, walks, and personal tasks.                                                                                                                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | CONTROL_DESIRE                 |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | But I appreciate reminders about events or when paperwork needs handling.                                                                                            | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Definitely. Especially if it can come with a kind tone, not just a buzzing alarm.                                                                                    | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                                |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Yes, I would. Especially if it's easy to set up and doesn't overload me with too much at once.                                                                       | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Remind me about meals, medicine, and appointments                                                                                                                    | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Keep track of my day in a simple way                                                                                                                                 | TASK_CONFIRMATION              | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |

| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wake up early, usually around the same time as Mr. Chang—he's always up by 6 a.m. I prepare breakfast for both of us.                                              | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I check in periodically, make sure he eats lunch, and handle dinner after my part-time shift at the store.                                                           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |

| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | He doesn't take many medications right now, but when he needs reminders, I usually just tell him directly.                                                           | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | He doesn't like being "nagged," so I try to keep it casual or make it part of our regular chat during meals.                                                         | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Appointments are tricky—he doesn't like going to doctors, and only his daughter, Ms. Chang, can really convince him.                                                 | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Yes, my sister-in-law (his daughter) is involved. She calls him every day and visits on weekends.                                                                    | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | We talk by phone occasionally if something important comes up—like if he's more confused than usual or needs something only she can address.                         | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | We coordinate his medical care through her since he listens to her more.                                                                                             | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It's hard when he repeats himself or gets confused and doesn't realize it.                                                                                           | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I have to stay patient without correcting him too much, which takes emotional energy.                                                                                | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Yes, especially when I'm at work. I worry he might forget something on the stove or open the door to a stranger.                                                     | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED      |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | So far nothing serious has happened, but I'm always a little on edge.                                                                                                | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | They wear me down over time. It's not physically demanding, but emotionally, it's draining.                                                                          | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I often feel like I have to do everything twice—once for him, then again to double-check.                                                                            | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | And I have less time and energy for myself.                                                                                                                          | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I don't use apps for caregiving specifically. Mr. Chang uses his phone for calls and voice messages, mostly with his daughter, but that's it.                        | TECH_RESISTANCE                | VOICE_PREFERENCE               |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | He's not open to learning new tech.                                                                                                                                  | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Not much—just calendar reminders on my own phone to track appointments or shopping.                                                                                  | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | We haven't tried anything like smart devices or tracking tools.                                                                                                      | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It needs to be extremely simple. If it has more than one button or screen, Mr. Chang won't touch it.                                                                 | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | For me, I can manage apps, but I don't want anything that takes a long time to set up or update every day.                                                           | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I need something that works quietly in the background.                                                                                                               | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wish I had help keeping track of his routine when I'm not home.                                                                                                    | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Something to ease the mental burden of checking and double-checking things like meals, safety, and whether he's feeling okay.                                        | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Yes, especially during my work hours. Even just a little reassurance that everything is fine at home would ease my mind a lot.                                       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Voice reminders that sound like a family member                                                                                                                      | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Simple yes/no check-ins that I can review                                                                                                                            | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Alerts if he misses meals or doesn't respond                                                                                                                         | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | A way for his daughter to stay involved too—maybe share access                                                                                                       | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Not requiring Mr. Chang to push buttons or navigate screens                                                                                                          | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Remote check-ins with simple confirmation (Did he have breakfast?)                                                                                                   | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | A log of what he did or didn't respond to                                                                                                                            | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Gentle, pre-recorded reminders from a familiar voice                                                                                                                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Weekend coordination features for his daughter                                                                                                                       | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Honestly, it sounds promising—if it's truly simple and doesn't require much effort from Mr. Chang.                                                                   | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I'd be more open if it helps me without making things harder for him.                                                                                                | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Yes, I worry about the setup being complicated.                                                                                                                      | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Also, Mr. Chang might resist anything that feels like surveillance or "treatment."                                                                                   | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It has to feel natural—like part of his day, not something clinical.                                                                                                 | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Yes, as long as the setup is easy and it respects his independence.                                                                                                  | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I'd probably ask his daughter to help introduce it—he listens to her more.                                                                                           | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Time for your tea. Gentle voice reminder (maybe from his daughter) to keep his routine consistent.                                                                   | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Did you eat breakfast? Simple yes/no check-in so I can see if he's on track.                                                                                         | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Lunch time. Reminder, especially useful when I'm not home.                                                                                                           | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Did you take your walk or stretch a bit? Encouragement to move around a little; he often forgets.                                                                    | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Dinner will be ready soon. To help him mentally prepare, so he doesn't snack and skip meals.                                                                         | MEAL_REMINDERS                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Turn off the stove/lights if you're not using them. Gentle safety check to avoid forgetful accidents.                                                                | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Your daughter is visiting tomorrow. He forgets and gets flustered when surprised. This helps him prepare.                                                            | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Check if anything needs to be restocked (tea, snacks, meds). Gives me or his daughter a heads-up on what to bring or buy.                                            | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | If he doesn't confirm a meal or task twice in a row, I'd like to be notified (via the app or a quiet alert), so I can call or check in with him.                     | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                             |                       |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I would use pre-recorded reminders in his daughter's voice for sensitive or personal messages. He responds better to her and is more likely to listen.               | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | During the week, I check in with my father multiple times a day through phone calls and short voice messages.                                                        | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I ask how he's feeling, what he's eaten, and whether he's done basic things like making tea or turning off the stove.                                                | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I visit him in person every weekend to assess how he's really doing and help with tasks that might be slipping through the cracks.                                   | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Because he doesn't acknowledge his memory loss, I have to be subtle.                                                                                                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I'll call before an appointment and say something like, Just checking if you're still up for our plan today, rather than reminding him he forgot.                    | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I also try to leave visual cues when I visit — like writing on a calendar or leaving appointment notes near the TV or kettle.                                        | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Yes. My sister-in-law, Mrs. Chang, lives with him and manages his meals and basic safety around the house.                                                           | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | We keep in touch over the phone or by text to coordinate visits or handle anything urgent.                                                                           | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | She handles the daily physical caregiving, and I provide emotional support and oversee bigger concerns, like appointments or changes in behavior.                    | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | His stubbornness is the hardest part. He refuses to go to the doctor or admit anything is wrong, which limits what we can do.                                        | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Also, the repetition in our conversations can be emotionally draining, though I try to stay patient.                                                                 | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Yes — especially during the week when I'm not there. I worry he'll leave the stove on, fall, or not eat properly.                                                    | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | His hearing loss adds to the concern, because if he doesn't hear something (like a knock or phone ring), he might miss help.                                         | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | They increase the time I spend checking in and second-guessing things.                                                                                               | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I'll often have to repeat conversations or drive out unexpectedly when something seems off.                                                                          | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Emotionally, it's tiring to always be "on alert."                                                                                                                    | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I do — I use my phone calendar and reminders to keep track of his appointments.                                                                                      | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | He only uses his phone for voice calls and WhatsApp audio messages. That's it.                                                                                       | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | We haven't tried much, honestly. I've looked into some devices, but nothing feels usable for his level of tech comfort.                                              | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Even something like a smart speaker is a stretch for him.                                                                                                            | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | For me: if it syncs across devices and gives me updates without needing too much input, it's helpful.                                                                | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | For him: if it's visual, automatic, and doesn't require tapping buttons or navigating menus.                                                                         | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN        |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | If there's too much complexity, he won't engage with it.                                                                                                             | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Remote monitoring — knowing if he's eaten, taken his pills, or turned off the stove.                                                                                 | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Emotional support or connection tools for him — he's isolated and doesn't socialize much.                                                                            | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | A way to bridge communication when I'm not around, especially as his memory declines.                                                                                | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Absolutely. If I could see simple indicators — like when he made tea, watched TV, or moved around — I'd feel more confident leaving him alone during the week.       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Passive tracking (e.g., motion sensors or activity updates)                                                                                                          | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | A way for me to send him gentle reminders that feel like "chat messages"                                                                                             | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Shared schedules that I could update and he could see without much effort                                                                                            | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Voice-based reminders that use my voice or a familiar tone                                                                                                           | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      | VOICE_PREFERENCE               |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Alerts to me if he doesn't engage with something by a certain time                                                                                                   | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                             |                       |

| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Real-time activity updates                                                                                                                                           | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | A shared dashboard for tracking meals, meds, or routines                                                                                                             | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | A simple caregiver log I could update after visits                                                                                                                   | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | But it has to be very, very simple for him or he won't use it.                                                                                                       | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Yes — the setup process. If it involves configuring multiple devices or teaching him something new, it might not work.                                               | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I'd need to do everything on my end and have it run passively for him.                                                                                               | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Yes, if it's gentle and unobtrusive. I'd absolutely be open to testing something like this, especially if it helps me support him without making him feel "managed." | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION       |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Morning, Baba. Did you make your tea yet?                                                                                                                            | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | He always makes tea, but this helps maintain routine and lets me know he's up.                                                                                       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Just checking — have you eaten anything this morning?                                                                                                                | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | He sometimes forgets meals, and this opens the door for me to check in later.                                                                                        | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Light reminder in my voice: Did you take your pills this morning?                                                                                                    | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | FAMILIAR_VOICE_PREFERENCE      |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Only if he agrees; currently he resists this, so I'd hold off until needed.                                                                                          | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | You've been sitting for a while — stretch your legs?                                                                                                                 | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Did you eat yet? What did Mrs. Chang cook today?                                                                                                                     | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Keeps him engaged and aware of the time without sounding like a demand.                                                                                              | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | TIME_DISORIENTATION            |                             |                       |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Time to wind down for the evening. Want to watch something relaxing?                                                                                                 | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                                |                             |                       |

| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Multiple notifications — too many would make him annoyed or suspicious                                                                                               | MINIMAL_NOTIFICATIONS          | NON_INTRUSIVE_DESIGN           |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | My mornings start with making sure Jane takes her medication, eats breakfast, and is settled before I leave for work.                                                | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS    |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | I prep lunch for her and leave reminders.                                                                                                                            | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | After work, I manage dinner, review her day, help with meds again, and ensure she's relaxed before bed.                                                              | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS    |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Weekends are more hands-on: gardening together, errands, and checking in on any health or mood changes.                                                              | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |

| John          | Caregiver    | I often text or call her during the day to remind her about medications or check how she's doing.                                                                    | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS      |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Our son visits about once a month. He helps with tech support—setting up phone reminders or explaining apps—but he's not involved in day-to-day care.                | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES |                                |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | There's no formal coordination, but I update him now and then.                                                                                                       | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | The emotional strain of seeing Jane's changes and juggling everything—work, home, and her care—is overwhelming.                                                      | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | It's lonely too, not having a real break or time for myself.                                                                                                         | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Absolutely. Even with routines, I worry if she's okay when I'm at work—if she forgot to eat or take her meds, or if she wandered outside or got confused.            | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED      |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Repeating myself constantly wears me down.                                                                                                                           | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | I often feel mentally drained and have little energy left for anything else after work and caregiving duties.                                                        | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | I use my phone to set reminders and calendar alerts.                                                                                                                 | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Jane uses basic phone functions—texts, calls, and Facebook—but she doesn't initiate reminders or use new apps unless I set them up.                                  | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | SETUP_SIMPLICITY               |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | We've tried Google Calendar, basic alarms, and a shared grocery list app.                                                                                            | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Easy tools are visual, simple, and don't need frequent updates.                                                                                                      | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Hard ones require too many steps or have cluttered interfaces.                                                                                                       | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Jane gets overwhelmed by anything not intuitive.                                                                                                                     | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | I need emotional support and better ways to monitor her well-being while I'm at work.                                                                                | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                             |                       |
| John          | Caregiver    | Also, clearer routines for her that don't rely on me constantly checking in.                                                                                         | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | AUTONOMY_PRESERVATION          |                             |                       |

| Ally          | Caregiver    | My day starts early. I help my mom get up, take her medication, and make her breakfast.                                                                              | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I usually check her oxygen levels if her breathing seems off.                                                                                                        | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I try to leave notes or use sticky reminders before heading to work.                                                                                                 | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I text or call her during lunch to check in.                                                                                                                         | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | COMMUNICATION_PATTERNS         | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS    |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | After work, I handle everything—dinner, laundry, cleaning, helping her get ready for bed.                                                                            | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Most evenings are spent just trying to stay on top of household chaos                                                                                                | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I use a paper calendar and sticky notes around the house.                                                                                                            | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I also try to remind her verbally, especially in the morning and evening.                                                                                            | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | She sometimes uses her phone's alarm for medication, but it doesn't always work well if she forgets what it's for.                                                   | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Not really. Family visits on weekends sometimes, but I'm the one who does everything daily.                                                                          | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I've asked for more help, but it hasn't really changed.                                                                                                              | FAMILY_COORDINATION_CHALLENGES | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The emotional exhaustion. She doesn't always recognize her memory problems, and it's frustrating repeating things or finding messes she forgot she made.             | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The physical toll of cleaning, cooking, and managing her health—on top of working full-time—is just overwhelming.                                                    | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Constantly. I worry about her forgetting to turn off the stove or taking the wrong medicine.                                                                         | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Sometimes I'm afraid to even leave the house for work.                                                                                                               | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 | WORK_CARE_BALANCE_STRESS       |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I lose hours redoing things—reminding her of tasks, cleaning up accidents or confusion, or calming her down when she gets agitated.                                  | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I'm always mentally on alert. I don't sleep well, and it's hard to have energy for anything else.                                                                    | EMOTIONAL_EXHAUSTION           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I do. She mostly just uses her phone for Facebook or calls.                                                                                                          | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I've tried setting alarms or reminders for her, but if she doesn't understand them in the moment, they're not much help.                                             | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Just phone alarms, calendar alerts, and medication apps (for me, not her).                                                                                           | EXISTING_REMINDER_METHODS      |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I looked into smart home tech, but we can't afford it, and she wouldn't be comfortable with too much change.                                                         | TECH_RESISTANCE                |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | For me, it has to be fast and simple—I'm always multitasking.                                                                                                        | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | For her, big text, clear icons, and limited steps are key.                                                                                                           | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Anything confusing makes her upset. If she clicks the wrong thing, she'll panic.                                                                                     | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | I need help monitoring her daily when I'm not home.                                                                                                                  | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Also, someone to talk to—I'm completely isolated.                                                                                                                    | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Yes. If I could see that she took her meds or ate or just had a calm day, it would ease so much anxiety.                                                             | REMOTE_MONITORING_NEED         | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           |                             |                       |

| Ally          | Caregiver    | If it could also gently redirect her when she's confused (e.g., a voice that reminds her what time it is or what to do next), that would be a game-changer.          | VOICE_PREFERENCE               | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    | TIME_DISORIENTATION         |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Honestly? Relieved that something like this exists. I've felt completely alone trying to hold everything together.                                                   | ISOLATION_CONCERNS             |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | If the app actually works and doesn't confuse her, I'd be so grateful.                                                                                               | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Just how user-friendly it is. If it's too complicated or buggy, it'll stress both of us out more.                                                                    | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Also, I need to trust that it won't mess up and make her more confused.                                                                                              | TECH_LEARNING_ANXIETY          |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Take morning medication. Include a photo of her pill organizer and a short voice reminder like: Good morning, it's time to take your pills now.                      | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           | VOICE_PREFERENCE            |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Eat breakfast. Prompt to check the kitchen and maybe suggest simple food options she likes (e.g., toast, cereal).                                                    | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | SIMPLICITY_PREFERENCE          |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Stretch or light movement. Simple chair exercises for arthritis. Could use a short video or checklist.                                                               | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Eat lunch. Remind her to check the fridge (I'll leave a labeled lunch container ahead of time).                                                                      | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | VISUAL_CLARITY_NEEDS           |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Hydration reminder. A quick, friendly prompt: Time to have a glass of water.                                                                                         | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Quiet activity. Suggest something gentle, like looking through old photo albums, a craft box, or coloring pages. Something calming.                                  | ENCOURAGEMENT_NEED             |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Take afternoon medication. Another pill reminder with a voice note: Don't forget your afternoon pills.

| Ally          | Caregiver    | Dinner time. Prompt her to wait for me or heat up what I've left prepared.                                                                                           | MEAL_REMINDERS                 | FAMILY_SUPPORT_RELIANCE        |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Take night medication and prepare for bed. Gentle wind-down prompt. Maybe play calming music.                                                                        | MEDICATION_REMINDERS           | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Call with family. Prompt her to check her phone or wait for a video call.                                                                                            | SOCIAL_CONNECTION_DESIRE       |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Garbage day prep. Gentle reminder for her to let me know if anything needs to go out.                                                                                | DAILY_ROUTINE_FORGETTING       | GENTLE_REMINDERS_PREFERENCE    |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Don't use the stove alone reminder. Timed around meal prep hours, just in case she forgets.                                                                          | SAFETY_ANXIETY                 |                                |                             |                       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Emergency contact button.

| Ally          | Caregiver    | Missed task alerts. If she skips medication or doesn't interact with the app, I'd like a notification so I can call her or check in.                                 | CAREGIVER_DASHBOARD            | MEDICATION_MEMORY_ISSUES       | SAFETY_ANXIETY              |                       |
