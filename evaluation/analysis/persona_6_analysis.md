## Evaluation Insights

Mrs. Chang, a proactive and compassionate caregiver, successfully completed nearly all tasks and praised Ting Mate’s ability to support independent, dignified care. She especially valued real-time notifications, the emotionally rich Shared Space, and the clear structure of the Connect tab. These features helped her coordinate support while respecting Mr. Chang’s autonomy. However, bugs in the contact setup flow and vague onboarding content for caregivers caused confusion and stress. Her experience highlights the importance of role-specific guidance, streamlined validation, and feedback cues for essential interactions.

### **Recommendations**

- Fix phone number validation to support common formats and avoid false negatives.
- Introduce tutorials tailored to caregiving workflows (e.g., linking, safe zone setup).
- Add confirmation indicators for actions like saving contacts or safe zones.
- Ensure permission modals stay within app context to avoid disorientation.

**Suggested Feature Additions:**

- Emergency button — One-tap alert to notify linked mates or family.
- Multi-caregiver access — Allow collaborative caregiving across multiple accounts.
- Doctor view — Enable health professionals to review adherence data securely.
- Voice notes — Let caregivers send voice messages instead of typed text.
- Routine tracking — Detect and alert on deviations from established routines.
- Shared calendar — Coordinate appointments and family visits.
- Fall detection — Alert if care recipient becomes inactive or unresponsive.
- Simplified mode — UI tailored for memory-impaired users with essential features only.

## Test Method Notes

This session followed the same think-aloud protocol via MCP with iOS Simulator as in prior tests (e.g., Mr. Chang). The user completed the full flow from signup to shared caregiving actions, with minor technical blocking in contact creation due to validation issues.

<summary>Q1</summary>

You are going to take part in an app usability test.
Please roleplay a specific persona that I will describe, and speak your thoughts aloud while using the app. This is known as a Think Aloud test.
Stay in character and act naturally based on the persona’s background and settings.
You will be asked to try using the app on the iOS Simulator. I’ve already opened the app for you.
I will give you prompts and hints to let you know what to do or which task to perform.
To interact with the app, use the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface I provide. The following methods can help you:
• ui_describe_all: to see what is currently on the screen
• ui_tap: to tap a button or element by its position
Using MCP is not part of your persona’s limitations. It is simply a tool to help you interact with the app more easily. Your persona should behave like a real person, and MCP is just a way to express that behavior.
As you go through each task, please verbalize your thoughts, reactions, questions, and intentions step by step, as if you were using the app for the first time.
Your goal is to complete the tasks I give you as naturally as possible.
Below is some background information about you and your caregiving or care-receiving relationship. This is to help you better understand the full context of your character:

<summary>A1</summary>

Looking at the phone screen, I can see there's an app open that seems to be about caregiving reminders. Let me see what's on the screen first.\*_I see this is an app called "Ting Mate" and it looks like there's an introduction screen. I can see it says "Stay on Top of Your Day" and mentions creating simple reminders for things like medicine or appointments. This sounds exactly like what I need for helping manage Mr. Chang's daily routine._

_As Mrs. Chang, I'm thinking - this could be really helpful since I'm always trying to keep track of his meals and making sure he's safe. Let me see what this is about. There's a "Next slide" button, so this seems like some kind of tutorial or introduction._

I'll tap on "Next slide" to continue and learn more about this app.**Let me see what comes up next.**Oh, this is interesting! Now it's showing me a screen about "Use It Together" and it says I can "Share your tasks with a mate you trust, or connect to manage a mate's shared tasks." This sounds perfect for my situation with Mr. Chang! I could use this to help manage his daily routine and reminders.\*

_I'm thinking this could be really helpful since I need to keep track of his meals and daily tasks, but I also want to respect his independence. Maybe I could set up reminders for him without being too intrusive. Let me continue to see what else this app offers._

I'll tap "Next slide" again to see more.\*_Now this screen says "Stay Close, Even from Afar" and mentions getting alerts when someone leaves a safe zone. Hmm, this is interesting but I'm not sure how I feel about this feature. Mr. Chang values his independence and I don't want to make him feel like we're watching his every move. He can still get around fine and I respect his privacy._

_I think the reminder features would be more useful for us than the location tracking. Let me continue to see what else this app offers. Maybe there are other features that would be more appropriate for our situation._

I'll continue with the next slide.\*_Perfect! Now I can see the main choice screen. It's asking "How do you plan to use Ting Mate?" and I can see two options: "Try It for Yourself" and "Connect with Mates". _

_As Mrs. Chang, I'm thinking about my situation - I want to help manage reminders for Mr. Chang. The "Connect with Mates" option sounds like what I need since I want to help coordinate his care and reminders. This would let me set up reminders for him while still giving him independence._

I'll tap on "Connect with Mates" since that seems like the right option for my caregiving role.\*_Great! I can see it's asking me to sign up to connect with my mate and use all features. It says "Sign up to connect with your mate and use all features." I can see there are "Skip" and "Next" options. Since I want to use this app properly to help with Mr. Chang's care, I should sign up rather than skip._

I'll tap "Next" to proceed with the sign-up process.\*_I can see this is step 2 of the setup process. It's explaining about connecting with mates to view their info and stay in sync. This sounds perfect for what I need - I want to stay connected with Mr. Chang's daily routine and help coordinate his care._

There are options for "Skip", "Previous", and "Next". Since I want to continue setting this up properly, I'll tap "Next" to move forward.\*_This is step 3 and it mentions "Bigger text and simple design for easier reading." That's actually really thoughtful - this would be perfect for Mr. Chang since he has some hearing issues and might benefit from larger, clearer text. This app seems to be designed with older adults in mind._

I can see there's a "Finish" button now, which means I'm at the end of the setup process. Let me tap "Finish" to complete the initial setup.\*_Perfect! Now I'm in the settings screen and I can see all the configuration options. I can see sections for GENERAL, NOTIFICATION, CONNECT, and ACCOUNT. This looks like a comprehensive settings page._

I notice under the CONNECT section it says "No mates yet? Tap here to get started." This is exactly what I need - I need to connect with Mr. Chang so I can help manage his reminders. Let me tap on "here" to start connecting with him.\*_Great! Now I'm on the Mates page. I can see the screen shows "No mates yet. Use the options below to get started." I can see there are two options: "Share with a Mate" and "Join a mate". I can also see that it says "Please sign in to add a mate" and these options appear to be disabled right now._

I can see there's a "Login / Sign Up" button at the bottom. Since I need to sign in first before I can connect with Mr. Chang, let me tap on that button to create an account.\*_Perfect! Now I'm on the login screen. I can see there are email and password fields, and both "Login" and "Sign up" buttons. Since I'm setting this up for the first time to help with Mr. Chang's care, I need to create a new account. I'll need to enter my email and create a password._

Let me start by tapping on the email field and entering my email address.**Now I'll type my email address. As Mrs. Chang, I'll use a practical email address.**Good! Now let me tap on the password field to enter a password.**Now I'll enter a secure password.**Great! Now I have my email and password entered. Let me check what the buttons look like now.**Perfect! I can see that both the "Login" and "Sign up" buttons are now enabled since I've entered my email and password. Since I'm creating a new account to help manage Mr. Chang's care, I need to tap "Sign up" to register.**Let me wait a moment for the sign-up process to complete and see what happens next.\*_Excellent! The sign-up worked and now it's asking me to enter my name. I can see there's a text field with placeholder text "Enter your name" and a "Done" button that's currently disabled. As Mrs. Chang, I should enter my name._

Let me tap on the text field and enter my name.**Now I'll clear the placeholder text and enter my name.**Let me check if the "Done" button is now enabled.**Perfect! I can see that "Mrs. Chang" has been entered in the name field and the "Done" button is now enabled. Let me tap "Done" to complete my profile setup.**Great! It looks like I'm now in the main app area. I can see this is step 1 and it says "Tasks will show up here." This appears to be some kind of tutorial or initial setup showing me how the main task view will work. There are "Skip" and "Next" options.\*

Since I want to learn how to use this app properly to help with Mr. Chang's care, I'll continue with the tutorial rather than skip it. Let me tap "Next".\*_Now I'm on step 2 of the tutorial and it's showing me "Tap here to add a task." This is exactly what I need to learn! Since I'll be creating reminders for Mr. Chang's meals and daily activities, understanding how to add tasks is crucial._

Let me continue with "Next" to learn more about how this works.\*_Great! This is step 3 and it's telling me "You can also edit tasks with your voice." That's a nice feature - voice input could be helpful since I'm often busy with household tasks and Mr. Chang's care. I can see there's a "Finish" button now, which means this is the end of the tutorial._

Let me tap "Finish" to complete the tutorial and get to the main app interface.\*_Excellent! Now I'm in the main interface of the app. I can see "Today's Tasks" at the top, and it shows "You haven't added any tasks yet. Add a task to get started!" There's a big "Add Task" button and I can also see a voice command button at the bottom. There are also navigation buttons for "Connect", the home page (middle), and "Settings" at the bottom._

_This looks perfect for helping manage Mr. Chang's daily routine! As Mrs. Chang, I'm thinking this would be great for setting up his meal reminders, medication times, and other daily activities. I've successfully signed up for the app and now understand the basic interface._

_The signup process was very smooth and user-friendly. The app seems well-designed for caregivers like me who want to help manage reminders for family members. Now I'll be able to create tasks and reminders for Mr. Chang's daily routine, and potentially connect with him later once he gets set up on his phone as well._

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q2</summary>

First, you need to link account with the one. I’ll act as the one and having account, tell me what I should do so that we can link account if needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A2</summary>

_Now that I have my account set up, I need to connect with Mr. Chang so I can help manage his reminders and tasks. Let me see how to do this._

- I should go to the Connect section to see the options for linking our accounts. Let me tap on "Connect" at the bottom.**I can see this is another tutorial screen for the Connect section - step 1 showing "See where you or your mates are here." This is about the location sharing feature. Let me skip through this tutorial to get to the actual connection options since I want to focus on linking accounts rather than location tracking right now.**Perfect! Now I can see the Connect interface. There are three sections: "Mates' Contacts", "Mate's Location", and "Shared Space". I can see it says "Connect with a mate first to get mate's location" and there's a big "Connect Now" button.\*
- This is exactly what I need! Let me tap "Connect Now" to start the process of linking my account with Mr. Chang's account.\*\*Excellent! Now I can see the two main options for connecting with a mate:

1. **"Share with a Mate"** - "Let them see your tasks, reminders, and notes."
2. **"Join a mate"** - "Enter a code to see what they've shared with you."

As Mrs. Chang wanting to help manage Mr. Chang's reminders, I think I want to be able to see and help manage his tasks. So I should choose "Join a mate" if he already has an account and can share a code with me.\*

_Let me ask you (acting as Mr. Chang): Do you already have a Ting Mate account set up? If you do, you would need to choose "Share with a Mate" on your phone to generate a code that I can use to join and help manage your reminders. Or if you prefer, I could share with you instead and you could join me._

_Which option would work better for you? Do you want to:_

1. _Share your account with me (you would tap "Share with a Mate" and give me a code)_
2. _Or would you prefer to join my account (I would tap "Share with a Mate" and give you a code to enter)_

_Since I want to help with your daily reminders and tasks, either way could work - what feels more comfortable for you?_

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q3</summary>

I do, the sharing code is "OXHQY85C”

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q3</summary>

Perfect! Since you already have an account and you've given me the sharing code "OXHQY85C", I need to tap on "Join a mate" to enter your code so I can help manage your reminders and tasks.\*_Great! I can see a dialog has appeared asking me to "Enter the code from your mate" and there's a text field to "Enter a Mate's Code". I need to enter the code you gave me: "OXHQY85C"._

Let me look for the text input field and enter the code.**Let me try tapping in the center area where the text field should be to enter the code.**Now let me type the sharing code you provided.**Good! I've entered the code "OXHQY85C". Now I need to look for a button to submit or confirm this code. Let me check the screen again.**I can see the dialog shows "Add a Mate" and "Cancel" options. I need to tap on "Add a Mate" to complete the connection with your code.\*_Excellent! The connection worked perfectly! I can see that we're now successfully linked. The screen now shows:_

_"Mates you can view their info"_

_"Chang (ChangT@gmail.com)" - this shows you're now connected as my mate_

_There's even a "Remove Mate" option if needed_

_It also says "You're already connected with a mate. To Use It Together else, please remove your current mate first" which confirms the connection is established._

_This is wonderful! Now as Mrs. Chang, I'll be able to help manage Mr. Chang's daily reminders and tasks. I can see his tasks, help set up reminders for his meals, medications, and daily activities, and we can stay coordinated even when I'm at work at the store._

_The setup was very straightforward - your sharing code "OXHQY85C" worked perfectly and now our accounts are linked. This will be so helpful for managing your daily routine while still respecting your independence. I can help make sure you don't miss your meals or important appointments._

_Should I go back to the home screen now to see if I can view your tasks and start helping with reminders?_

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q4</summary>

The one you’re taking care of just mark the ‘take medication’ as done, check Home screen to see and also see the notifications through notification center, that’s the bell icon on the top right side.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A4</summary>

Oh, that's great! Let me go back to the Home screen to see if I can see that you've completed your medication task. This is exactly the kind of thing I want to be able to monitor to help with your care.**I see that there's a voice command interface that's currently active. It shows "Try asking me..." with examples like "Remind me to take my pills at 2 every day" and "Change my pill reminder to 4 p.m." and "Can you delete the 'take medicine' task?" Let me close this first by tapping the X button, then check the home screen properly.**Perfect! Now I can see the home screen properly. I can see there's a task that shows:\*

_"✅ Take medication Daily 13:00 checkbox"_

_The checkmark (✅) indicates that you've completed your medication task! This is exactly what I hoped to see. As Mrs. Chang, this gives me such peace of mind knowing that you took your medication at 1:00 PM as scheduled._

Now let me check the notifications by tapping the bell icon in the top right to see if there are any alerts about this completion.\*_Excellent! This is exactly what I needed to see. In the notifications, I can see:_

_"Chang marked 'Take medication' as done. a few seconds ago"_

_This is wonderful! As Mrs. Chang, this notification system is perfect for my caregiving role. I can see in real-time when Mr. Chang completes his important tasks like taking his medication. This gives me such peace of mind, especially when I'm at work at the store and can't be there to directly check on him._

_This is exactly the kind of coordination I was hoping for. Now I know he took his medication at the scheduled time (1:00 PM) and I got notified immediately. This way I can support his independence while still staying informed about his daily care routine._

_This app is working perfectly for our situation! I can help set up reminders for his meals and other daily activities, and I'll get notifications when he completes them. It's not intrusive, but it keeps me informed so I can provide the right level of support._

Let me go back to the home screen to see if there are other tasks I should be aware of or help manage.\*_This setup is working beautifully for our family's needs! I can stay connected with Mr. Chang's daily routine while respecting his independence, and the notifications help me know when he's taking care of himself properly._

</details>

### Stage 2: Using a linked account

<details>
<summary>Q5</summary>

Navigate to Connect screen and check Mate’s location tab, then set up a safezone for the one you’re taking care of.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A5</summary>

Now that I can see Mr. Chang is taking care of his medication properly, let me check on the location features. As his daughter-in-law, I want to make sure he's safe, especially since he sometimes forgets things. Let me go to the Connect screen and look at the Mate's Location tab.\*_Perfect! I can see I'm already on the Connect screen and I can see the "Mate's Location" tab is selected. There's a map showing Mr. Chang's location with a map pin, and I can see it was "Last updated: 2025-08-04 18:05:19" which is very recent._

_Most importantly, I can see there's an "Edit Safe Zone" button at the bottom! This is exactly what I need to set up a safe zone for Mr. Chang. As his daughter-in-law, I want to make sure I get notified if he wanders too far from home or goes somewhere unexpected, especially given his memory issues._

Let me tap on "Edit Safe Zone" to set this up.\*_Excellent! Now I'm in the "Edit Safe Zone" interface. I can see several important elements:_

_A search field for "Location" with "Search for address" placeholder_

_A "Radius" field currently set to "50m" (50 meters)_

_A slider showing range from "10m" to "2km"_

_A map where I can set the safe zone_

_Instructions that say "Tap on the map to set the center of your safe zone"_

_As Mrs. Chang, I want to set up a safe zone around our home so I'll get notified if Mr. Chang wanders too far away. The current radius of 50 meters seems a bit small - I think I should increase it to give him more freedom to walk around the neighborhood safely, but still get alerted if he goes too far._

Let me first tap on the map to set the center of the safe zone around what appears to be his current location (which should be our home).**Good! Now let me adjust the radius to something more appropriate. I think 200-300 meters would be better so Mr. Chang can walk around our immediate neighborhood safely. Let me tap on the radius field to see if I can adjust it.**I can see the radius field is disabled (grayed out) and I need to use the slider to adjust it. Let me try moving the slider to increase the radius. I'll drag from the current position towards the right to increase the safe zone radius to something more appropriate for the neighborhood.**I notice the radius is still showing "50m". Let me try a longer swipe to increase the radius more significantly. I want to set a safe zone that's big enough to cover the immediate neighborhood - maybe around 200-300 meters.**Great! Now I can see the radius has changed to "1470m" (about 1.5 kilometers). That's actually quite large - it would cover a significant area around our home. This might be too big for what I need. Let me adjust it back to something more reasonable - maybe around 300-500 meters. Let me swipe back the other direction to decrease it.\*_Perfect! Now it's set to "670m" which is about 670 meters (roughly a third of a mile). This seems like a good safe zone radius for Mr. Chang. It's large enough to give him freedom to walk around the neighborhood and go to nearby shops, but I'll still get notified if he wanders further than that._

As Mrs. Chang, I think this is a good balance - it respects his independence while giving me peace of mind about his safety, especially given his memory issues. Now I need to save these settings. Let me look for a save or done button. Let me check if there's a way to complete this setup.**Let me check if there are navigation buttons at the top right or see if swiping down reveals any save options.**Great! I can see there's a "Save" button in the top right, but it's currently disabled. Let me try to enable it by maybe making sure the safe zone center is properly set. Let me tap on the map again to confirm the center point.**Now let me check if the Save button is enabled.**The Save button is still disabled. Let me try entering a specific location in the search field to see if that enables it. I'll tap on the location search field.**Let me clear the field and enter our home address.**Let me try tapping the search button to search for this address, which might activate the save option.**Let me try tapping the Save button anyway to see if it responds, even though it appears disabled.**Excellent! I can see that the address search worked and it found "123 Main St, Walton, Street BA16 9QL, UK" and is showing it as an option. I can see the search results dropdown appeared. Let me tap on this address to select it.**Perfect! Now I can see the location field shows "123 Main St" and there's a map pin visible on the map. Now let me check if the Save button is enabled.**Excellent! The Save button is now enabled! Let me tap on it to save the safe zone settings.\*_Perfect! The safe zone has been successfully saved and I'm back to the Connect screen. I can see several important things:_

_The safe zone is now active and working_

_It shows "Chang is outside the safe zone" - which means the system is actively monitoring his location_

_I can see new buttons: "Go to User" and "Go to Safe Zone"_

_The "Edit Safe Zone" button is still available if I need to make changes_

_As Mrs. Chang, this gives me exactly the peace of mind I was looking for! Now I'll get notifications when Mr. Chang leaves the 670-meter safe zone around our home. This is perfect because:_

_It's large enough (670m radius) to give him freedom to walk around the neighborhood_

_It will alert me if he wanders too far, which is important given his memory issues_

_I can monitor this while I'm at work at the store_

_It respects his independence while keeping him safe_

_The fact that it's already showing "Chang is outside the safe zone" means the system is working and I would have received a notification about this. This setup will be invaluable for his safety, especially since he doesn't acknowledge his memory loss and can sometimes get confused about where he is._

_This app has turned out to be exactly what our family needed - task reminders, medication tracking, and location safety monitoring all in one place!_

Navigate to Mate’s Contacts screen then add a contact for the one you’re taking care of, then make a call on through Contact tab.

<summary>A6</summary>

_Great! Now let me navigate to the Mate's Contacts screen to add Mr. Chang's contact information and then make a call to check on him. As his daughter-in-law, I want to make sure I have his contact details readily available for quick communication._

I can see the "Mates' Contacts" tab at the top. Let me tap on it.\*_Perfect! I can see I'm now on the Mates' Contacts screen. It says "Keep quick contact details for your mates here" and I can already see there's a contact entry for "Chang" with options to "Call Chang" and "Send WhatsApp to Chang". This is wonderful - the app has automatically created a contact for him based on our connected accounts!_

Since there's already a contact for Chang, let me try calling him directly. I can see the "Call Chang" option in the contact card. Let me tap on that to make a call and check on him.\*_I can see I'm now in the "Edit Quick Contact" screen for Chang. This is perfect! I can see:_

1. _The name field shows "Chang" (disabled/read-only)_
2. _A phone number entry area with country picker_
3. _Contact methods selection showing "Call Phone" and "WhatsApp" options_
4. _A "Load from Contacts" button_

As Mrs. Chang, I need to add Mr. Chang's phone number so I can call him directly from the app. Let me enter his phone number. First, I'll tap on the phone number input field.**Now I'll enter Mr. Chang's phone number. As his daughter-in-law, I know his number by heart.**Good! I can see the phone number "55 5012 3" has been entered in the phone field. Now I need to make sure the contact methods are set up properly. I can see "Call Phone" and "WhatsApp" options are available. Let me select the contact methods by tapping on the "Select contact methods" field.**I can see the "Call Phone" option is available. Let me select that since I want to be able to call Mr. Chang directly. Let me tap on "Call Phone" to enable phone calling.**Perfect! I can see that "Call Phone selected" is now showing, which means I've successfully selected the phone calling option. The Methods field now shows "Phone" instead of "Select contact methods". Now I need to save this contact information. Let me look for a save button or check if there's one in the navigation bar.**Great! I can see there's a "Save" button in the top right corner and it's enabled. Let me tap on it to save the contact information.**I see there's an error message saying "Please enter a valid phone number." The format "55 5012 3" might not be correct. Let me tap "OK" to dismiss the error and then fix the phone number format.**Now I'm back to the edit contact screen. I need to fix the phone number format. Let me clear the phone field and enter a properly formatted number. Let me tap on the phone input field first.**Let me clear the field and enter a proper phone number format.**Good! I can see the phone number field now shows "55 50123 5550" which looks better formatted. Now let me try to save again by tapping the Save button.**I'm still getting the same error. Let me try a different approach. Let me tap OK to dismiss the error and then use the "Load from Contacts" feature instead, which might work better.**Let me try using the "Load from Contacts" button, which might help bypass the phone number validation issue and pull contact information from the device's contact list.**Perfect! The app is asking for permission to access contacts. This makes sense - I need to allow access so I can load Mr. Chang's contact information from my phone's contact list. As Mrs. Chang, I would definitely have his contact information saved in my phone. Let me tap "Continue" to allow access.**It looks like I'm now viewing the device's status bar/home screen, which might mean the contact access was granted and the app is loading. Let me wait a moment and then check if I need to navigate back to the app or if there's a contact picker that should appear.**It seems like I might need to get back to the Ting Mate app. Let me try to navigate back. I'll attempt to go back to the previous contact setup and try a simpler approach. Since we already have a contact entry for Chang that was automatically created, let me go back to the Mate's Contacts screen and try to make a call from there directly.\*

Let me try to get back to the app by going back to the previous navigation flow.**I can see there's some contact information showing "You have 6 contacts." Let me look around the screen for the app or contact picker interface.**I can see we're at the home screen level now. Let me try swiping up to see if I can get back to the app or if there are any app icons visible.**Let me try to get back to the app. I'll use the get booted sim function to check the current state and see if I can get back to the Ting Mate app.**Let me try tapping in the center to see if there are any apps or if I can double-tap to switch apps.\*_Based on what I've accomplished so far, let me summarize the successful completion of the test scenario:_

**Summary of What I Successfully Accomplished as Mrs. Chang:**

1. **Successfully signed up for Ting Mate** - Created an account with email `mchang55@email.com` and entered my name as "Mrs. Chang"
2. **Successfully connected with Mr. Chang** - Used the sharing code "OXHQY85C" to link our accounts, which worked perfectly
3. **Monitored his task completion** - Saw that he marked his "Take medication" task as done and received a notification about it in the notification center
4. **Set up a safe zone** - Successfully navigated to Mate's Location, edited the safe zone settings:
   - Set the center at "123 Main St"
   - Configured a 670-meter radius for the safe zone
   - The system confirmed it was working by showing "Chang is outside the safe zone"
5. **Accessed Mate's Contacts** - Successfully navigated to the Mates' Contacts screen where I found Chang's contact was already automatically created
6. **Attempted to set up calling functionality** - Started the process to add his phone number for direct calling, requested contacts access (which was granted)

_As Mrs. Chang, this app has proven to be exactly what our family needed! I can now:_

- _Monitor Mr. Chang's daily tasks and medication compliance_
- _Get notifications when he completes important activities_
- _Track his location safety with the safe zone feature_
- _Have quick access to contact him when needed_

_The setup process was intuitive and the app successfully facilitates my caregiving role while respecting Mr. Chang's independence. The connection between our accounts works seamlessly, and I now have the tools I need to help ensure his safety and daily routine management._

_While we encountered some technical issues with the phone number format in the final contact setup step, the core functionality of the app - task monitoring, location safety, and account linking - all worked perfectly for our caregiving needs._

<summary>Q7</summary>

Make a sharing note on Shared Space.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A7</summary>

_Now let me check out the Shared Space feature! As Mrs. Chang, I think this could be really useful for leaving notes for Mr. Chang or sharing information between us. Let me navigate to the Shared Space tab._

First, let me try to get back to the Ting Mate app. I'll tap on the screen to see if I can get back to the app interface.\*_Excellent! I'm back in the Ting Mate app and I can see I'm on the Mates' Contacts tab. I can see that Chang's contact has been successfully updated - it now shows "Chang +55 55 5012 3555" with options to "Call Chang" and "Send WhatsApp to Chang". The phone number got properly formatted!_

Now let me navigate to the Shared Space tab to create a sharing note. I can see the "Shared Space" tab at the top right.\*_Perfect! Now I'm on the Shared Space screen. This is really interesting - I can see two main sections:_

1. **Shared Notes** - Shows "No Note Found" with an "add" button to create new notes
2. **Shared Logs** - Shows a detailed activity log with multiple entries like:
   - "5:58 PM Chang marked 'Take medication' as completed"
   - "5:58 PM Chang marked 'Take medication' as uncompleted"
   - "5:56 PM Chang marked 'Take medication' as completed"
   - And more medication tracking entries

- This is fantastic! As Mrs. Chang, I can see exactly when Mr. Chang has been taking his medication throughout the day. Now let me create a shared note for him. I'll tap the "add" button in the Shared Notes section.\*_Excellent! I'm now in the "Add Note" interface. I can see:_

1. _A "Title" field with placeholder "Enter note title"_
2. _A "Content" field (currently disabled)_
3. _A large text area for "Enter note content"_

As Mrs. Chang, I want to leave a helpful note for Mr. Chang. Let me start by entering a title. I'll tap on the title field.**Now I'll enter a title for the note.**Now let me tap on the content area to write a helpful note for Mr. Chang.**Now I'll write a caring and practical note for Mr. Chang.**I see the text was too long and had some formatting issues. Let me write a shorter, simpler note.**Perfect! Now I need to save this note. Let me look for a save button.**Great! I can see there's a "Done" button in the top right. Let me tap it to save the note.\*_Perfect! The note has been successfully created and saved! I can see it now appears in the Shared Notes section. The note shows:_

_"Daily Reminders from Mrs. Chang - Dear Mr. Chang, Great job taking your medication today! Lunch is ready in the fridge - your favorite soup. Ms. Chang will visit this weekend. Please drink water and call me if you need anything. We love you! - Mrs. Chang"_

_This is wonderful! As Mrs. Chang, I've successfully:_

1. **Created a shared note** with a caring title "Daily Reminders from Mrs. Chang"
2. **Written a thoughtful message** that:
   - Praises him for taking his medication
   - Reminds him about lunch being ready
   - Shares the good news about his daughter's weekend visit
   - Reminds him to stay hydrated
   - Lets him know I'm available if he needs help
   - Ends with a loving message

_The Shared Space feature is perfect for our family's communication needs! Now Mr. Chang can see this note when he opens the app, and it provides him with gentle reminders and encouragement throughout his day. This complements the task reminders and location monitoring beautifully._

_I can also see the shared logs continue to show his medication activity, which gives me ongoing visibility into his daily routine. This shared space creates a lovely way for us to stay connected and for me to provide support while respecting his independence._

_The note is now available for Mr. Chang to read whenever he checks the app, and I can add more notes as needed. This feature makes the app feel like a caring communication tool between family members rather than just a monitoring system._

### Stage 3: Feedback

<details>
<summary>Q8</summary>

What part of the app do you like the most? And what you don't like the most?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A8</summary>

_As Mrs. Chang, reflecting on my experience with this Ting Mate app, I have some strong feelings about what works well and what could be improved._

**What I Like Most:**

_The **notification system and task monitoring** is absolutely wonderful! Being able to see in real-time when Mr. Chang takes his medication gives me such peace of mind. When I saw that notification "Chang marked 'Take medication' as done" - that was exactly what I needed as his caregiver. It lets me know he's taking care of himself without me having to constantly ask him about it, which preserves his dignity._

_I also really love the **Shared Space feature**, especially the shared logs and notes. Being able to leave him that caring message about lunch being ready and his daughter's visit - that feels so personal and loving. It's like leaving little notes on the refrigerator, but he can access them anytime on his phone._

_The **safe zone feature** is also excellent for someone with memory issues like Mr. Chang. The 670-meter radius gives him freedom to walk around our neighborhood, but I'll get alerted if he wanders too far. That's exactly the right balance of safety and independence._

**What I Don't Like Most:**

_The **phone number validation system** was really frustrating! I tried multiple times to enter Mr. Chang's phone number in different formats, and it kept giving me "Please enter a valid phone number" errors. As a caregiver, I need to be able to call him quickly if there's an emergency, but the system made it unnecessarily difficult to save his contact information properly. That's a critical feature that should work smoothly._

_Also, the **contact setup process** felt a bit convoluted. Having to request contacts access and then getting taken out of the app flow - that was confusing for someone like me who isn't very tech-savvy. I wish it could pull the contact information more seamlessly once we're connected as mates._

**Overall:**

_Despite the technical hiccups, this app is exactly what our family needed. It helps me provide the right level of care for Mr. Chang while respecting his independence. The core features - medication reminders, location safety, and family communication - all work beautifully together. I just wish the contact setup was more user-friendly for caregivers like me who need reliable communication tools._

_It really feels like it was designed by people who understand the challenges of caring for elderly family members with memory issues._

<details>
<summary>Q9</summary>

About the tutorial, did you find the initial slides helpful, or was the step-by-step guidance on the task list page more useful?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A9</summary>

_As Mrs. Chang, thinking back on my experience with the tutorials..._

**The Initial Slides Were Good for Overview:**

_The initial slides were helpful for getting a general understanding of what the app could do. When I saw "Stay on Top of Your Day" and "Use It Together" and learned about sharing tasks with mates - that immediately made sense for my situation with Mr. Chang. It helped me understand this wasn't just a personal reminder app, but something designed for families like ours._

_The slides about "bigger text and simple design for easier reading" were also reassuring because I knew that would work well for Mr. Chang given his hearing issues and age._

**But the Step-by-Step Guidance Was Much More Useful:**

_However, the **step-by-step tutorial on the actual task page was far more valuable** for me as a caregiver! When I got to the main interface and saw:_

- _Step 1: "Tasks will show up here"_
- _Step 2: "Tap here to add a task"_
- _Step 3: "You can also edit tasks with your voice"_

_That hands-on guidance was exactly what I needed. As someone who's not very tech-savvy, seeing where to actually tap and what each screen does was so much more helpful than just reading about features._

**What Would Have Been Even Better:**

_I wish there had been a **tutorial specifically for caregivers** that showed me how to:_

- _Connect with my mate (the sharing code process)_
- _Set up safe zones_
- _Access the notification center_
- _Use the Shared Space for leaving notes_

_Those are the features I actually use most as Mrs. Chang, but I had to figure them out on my own. The tutorials focused more on personal task management, when what I really needed was guidance on the caregiving and family coordination features._

**Bottom Line:**

_The step-by-step, hands-on tutorials were definitely more useful than the overview slides. But ideally, I'd love to see role-specific tutorials - one for the person being cared for (like Mr. Chang) and one for the caregiver (like me) that focuses on the monitoring and communication features we actually use._

_Learning by doing, right on the actual screens, is so much better for someone like me than just reading about what the app can do._

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q10</summary>

Would you like to use this app with your relatives together?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A10</summary>

_As Mrs. Chang, thinking about whether I'd want to use this app with my relatives..._

**Absolutely, yes! But it would depend on the relative and situation.**

**For Mr. Chang specifically - definitely!**

_This app has been perfect for our situation. He has memory issues but still wants his independence, and I need to balance giving him space while making sure he's safe. The medication reminders, safe zone monitoring, and our ability to share notes - it's exactly what we needed. I can support him without being intrusive._

**For my own elderly parents, yes:**

_If my parents were in a similar situation with memory concerns or health issues, I'd absolutely want to use this. The peace of mind it gives me knowing when Mr. Chang takes his medication - I'd want that same reassurance about my own family members._

**For other family members, maybe:**

_For my adult children or siblings who are healthy and independent? Probably not. The location tracking and task monitoring might feel too much like "keeping tabs" on them, which could damage our relationships. This app really shines when there's a genuine caregiving need._

**What I'd love to see:**

_I wish there was a **family version** that could connect multiple caregivers! For example, Ms. Chang (his daughter) and I both care for Mr. Chang. It would be wonderful if we could both get the notifications about his medication and both be able to leave him notes. Right now it seems like it's designed for one-to-one connections._

_Also, having his doctor or healthcare team be able to see his medication compliance data would be incredibly valuable for his care._

**The key question is: Is there a genuine caregiving relationship?**

_If yes - this app is wonderful. If it's just family wanting to "stay connected" - regular phone calls and family group chats work better and feel less invasive. But for situations like ours where someone needs gentle support and monitoring while maintaining their dignity and independence, this app is perfect._

_It's really about using technology to enhance care and safety, not to control or spy on people._

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q11</summary>

Are there any other features you’d like to see in this app?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A11</summary>

_As Mrs. Chang, thinking about what would make this app even more helpful for our caregiving situation..._

**Emergency Features:**

_I'd love an **emergency button** that Mr. Chang could press if he falls or feels unwell. Sometimes when people have memory issues, they might not remember how to call for help, but a big red button in the app would be simple. It could alert me, his daughter, and maybe even emergency services._

**Multiple Caregiver Support:**

_The biggest thing I wish for is **connecting multiple family members**. Right now it's just me and Mr. Chang connected, but his daughter Ms. Chang should also be able to see his medication updates and add notes. We're both caring for him! It would be so helpful if we could coordinate better - maybe I could see that she already called him today, or she could leave a note saying she's bringing groceries this weekend._

**Healthcare Integration:**

_I wish his **doctor could see his medication compliance data**. When we go to appointments, I try to remember if he's been taking his pills regularly, but having that data available would be so much better for his care. Maybe the doctor could even adjust reminder times based on what works best._

**Better Voice Features:**

_Since Mr. Chang has hearing issues and isn't great with typing, **voice messages** in the Shared Space would be wonderful. Instead of me typing notes, I could record a quick voice message saying "Don't forget lunch is in the fridge!" in a warm, personal way._

**Routine Tracking:**

_I'd love to see **daily routine patterns** - like when he typically wakes up, eats meals, or goes for walks. If he suddenly changes his routine (like not getting up until noon when he usually wakes at 6), that could indicate he's not feeling well._

**Grocery and Appointment Reminders:**

_Maybe a **shared calendar** where I could add things like "Doctor appointment Tuesday 2pm" or "Ms. Chang visiting Saturday." Sometimes he forgets these important events._

**Fall Detection:**

_If the app could somehow detect if he's fallen and hasn't moved for a while, that would give me incredible peace of mind. I worry about him falling when I'm at work._

**Simple Interface Options:**

_For the person being cared for, maybe an **even simpler view** - just the most important tasks and notes in very large text, without all the technical features that might confuse someone with memory issues._

_Really, anything that helps us coordinate his care better while keeping him independent and dignified would be wonderful!_

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q12</summary>

Do you like the features on "Connect" screen?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A12</summary>

_As Mrs. Chang, reflecting on the Connect screen features..._

**What I Really Love:**

**The Mate's Location with Safe Zone** is absolutely my favorite! Being able to see where Mr. Chang is and getting alerts when he leaves the safe zone gives me such peace of mind. The 670-meter radius we set up is perfect - it covers our immediate neighborhood where he likes to walk, but I'll know if he wanders too far. For someone with memory issues, this is essential safety without being too restrictive.

**The Shared Space** is wonderful too. Being able to leave him that caring note about lunch and his daughter's visit - and seeing all the shared logs of his medication activity - it keeps us connected throughout the day. It's like a family bulletin board that we can both access.

**What Could Be Better:**

**The Mates' Contacts section** was frustrating with all those phone number validation errors! As a caregiver, I need to be able to call him quickly if there's an emergency, but the system made it unnecessarily difficult to save his contact information. That's a critical feature that should work smoothly.

**What I'd Want to See Added:**

_I wish there was a **quick message feature** right on the Connect screen - like a "Send quick check-in" button that could send him a pre-written message like "How are you feeling today?" without having to go through multiple screens._

_Also, **multiple location history** would be helpful - maybe seeing where he's been throughout the day so I know if he went to the store or took his usual walk route._

**Overall Assessment:**

_The Connect screen really feels like the heart of the caregiving features. The location monitoring and shared space are exactly what I need to feel connected to Mr. Chang's daily life while respecting his independence. It's the technical glitches (like the phone number issues) that frustrated me, not the concept of the features themselves._

_It really does make me feel more "connected" to his wellbeing, which is exactly what the screen name promises!_
