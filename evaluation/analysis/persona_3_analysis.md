### Areas for Improvement

| Category         | Short Summary       | Description                                                                | Supporting Quote                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Time Picker      | Confusing interface | Could not interpret slider values, causing incorrect or failed time input. | _“All those sliding things with numbers like ‘5006’ and ‘4980’ – I had no idea what those meant.”_                        |
| Location Sharing | Privacy concerns    | Concerned about surveillance despite acknowledging potential usefulness.   | _“That location tracking slide about ‘safe zones’ actually made me a bit uncomfortable - it sounded like being watched.”_ |

## Evaluation Insights

This session demonstrated that Ting Mate could be helpful even for older adults with both memory issues and limited digital familiarity. Despite some UI confusion, the participant completed key tasks including adding reminders and accessing shared notes and contact information. She responded especially positively to voice commands and shared features, which enhanced her confidence and reduced emotional strain. Nonetheless, unintuitive interactions around time input, task completion, and location permissions were barriers to full success.

### **Recommendations**

- Replace slider-based time picker with clearer options (e.g. tap-based input, preset times).
- Separate task completion logic from task editing screens.
- Improve tap sensitivity and feedback for checkboxes.
- Consider reordering onboarding content to introduce location tracking later in the flow.

### **Test Method Notes**

This test used Claude connected to the iOS Simulator via `idb`, which reads the app’s interface in JSON format. Icons and some interactive elements (e.g. checkboxes, call buttons) were not reliably described, limiting certain actions. Failures to complete tasks were often due to simulation constraints, not app logic.

<summary>Q1</summary>

You are going to take part in an app usability test.
Please roleplay a specific persona that I will describe, and speak your thoughts aloud while using the app. This is known as a Think Aloud test.
Stay in character and act naturally based on the persona’s background and settings.
You will be asked to try using the app on the iOS Simulator. I’ve already opened the app for you.
I will give you prompts and hints to let you know what to do or which task to perform.
To interact with the app, use the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface I provide. The following methods can help you:
• ui_describe_all: to see what is currently on the screen
• ui_tap: to tap a button or element by its position
Using MCP is not part of your persona’s limitations. It is simply a tool to help you interact with the app more easily. Your persona should behave like a real person, and MCP is just a way to express that behavior.
As you go through each task, please verbalize your thoughts, reactions, questions, and intentions step by step, as if you were using the app for the first time.
Your goal is to complete the tasks I give you as naturally as possible.
Below is some background information about you and your caregiving or care-receiving relationship. This is to help you better understand the full context of your character:

Looking at the phone screen with a slightly confused expression
Oh, Ally must have opened something new on my phone again... Let me see what this is.Squinting at the screen and reading slowly
"Ting Mate"... what is this? adjusts my position to see better Oh, it says "Stay on Top of Your Day" and something about reminders and medicine...
Reading the description carefully
"Create simple reminders and check off tasks like medicine or appointments." Well, that sounds useful, I suppose. I do have trouble remembering when to take my pills sometimes, and Ally is always worried about my doctor appointments.
Looking at the buttons
There's a "Next slide" button here and a "Skip Onboarding" one. I don't know what "onboarding" means, but maybe I should see what this next slide thing shows me first? Ally always tells me not to skip things on the phone because I might miss something important.Tapping more deliberately on the "Next slide" buttonWaiting to see what happensReading the new screen
Oh, now it says "Use It Together" and... reading more slowly "Share your tasks with a mate you trust, or connect to manage a mate's shared tasks."
Looking confused
Hmm, "mate"... that's a funny word. Does it mean like a friend? Or is it talking about Ally? She's always trying to help me remember things... Maybe this is something she can use to help me keep track of my medicines and appointments?
Thinking out loud
This sounds complicated though. I don't really understand what "connect to manage" means. But if it can help Ally know when I need to take my pills, maybe that would be good. She worries so much about me forgetting.
Let me see what's next...Reading with a frown
"Stay Close, Even from Afar" and "Get alerts when your mate leaves a safe zone."
Looking worried and a bit frustrated
What? Safe zone? Leaves? I don't like this... This sounds like they want to track where I go. I'm not a child! I can still go to the market by myself sometimes, even with my arthritis.
Shifting uncomfortably
Ally already worries enough about me. I don't need her getting alerts every time I step outside. That's... that's too much. I still have some independence, you know. What if I want to visit my sister without Ally knowing right away?
Sighing
But I suppose... sometimes I do get confused about where I am. Last week I couldn't remember which bus to take home from the market. Maybe it's not such a bad idea?
Reluctantly
Let me see what else this thing does...Looking at the screen and reading carefully
"How do you plan to use Ting Mate?"
Seeing the two options
Oh, there are two choices here. I can see "Try It for Yourself" and "Connect with Mates".
Pausing to think
Well, I suppose I should try it for myself first, right? I don't really understand what "connecting with mates" means anyway. Is that like connecting with Ally? But she's not my mate, she's my daughter.
Speaking to herself
I always like to figure things out on my own first before asking for help. Even with this memory thing, I still want to try to be independent when I can. Maybe if I try it myself first, I can understand it better before involving Ally.
Looking at the "Try It for Yourself" option
Yes, I think I'll start with this one. Let me tap on it.Looking at the screen with some confusion
Oh... what happened? I see a "1" in the corner and it says "Tasks will show up here." There's a "Skip" and "Next" button too.
Looking around the screen
This looks different now. It's mostly empty. Is this... is this the main part of the app? Where I would see my tasks? But it's empty right now.
Reading the message again
"Tasks will show up here." Well, I suppose I don't have any tasks set up yet. That makes sense.
Looking at the options
I have Skip or Next. I wonder what Next will show me? Maybe it will help me create a task? That could be useful - I could set up a reminder for my blood pressure medicine. I always forget if I took it in the morning or not.
Let me try Next.Looking at the new screen with interest
Oh! Now there's a "2" and it says "Tap here to add a task." That's helpful!
Speaking with some excitement
So this is showing me where I would add a task. That's what I was thinking about - I could add a reminder for my blood pressure medication. Or maybe for my doctor's appointment next week... I always worry I'll forget those.
Looking at the buttons
Now I have Skip, Previous, and Next. I think I understand this better now. This is like a tutorial showing me how to use the app.
Thinking out loud
I wonder if I should actually try tapping where it says to add a task, or if I should just continue with the tutorial first to see what else it can do.
Maybe I'll continue with Next to see the rest of the tutorial first, and then I can come back and add a real task when I understand everything better.Reading the screen
"You can also edit tasks with your voice."
Looking surprised and a bit worried
Voice? Oh my... I don't know about talking to my phone. That seems very complicated. What if I say the wrong thing? What if it doesn't understand me with my voice? Sometimes I get the words mixed up, especially when I'm tired.
Sighing
I suppose Ally uses her voice with her phone sometimes. I see her talking to it to send messages. But I'm not sure I'm ready for that yet. I'd rather just use my fingers to tap things, like I do when I text my sister.
Looking at the options
I see there's a "3" now, and I can go Previous or Finish. I think I've seen enough of this tutorial for now. Let me finish this and try to actually use the app to add a task.
Tapping Finish**Looking at the main screen now
Oh good! Now this looks like the real app. I can see "Today's Tasks" at the top, and it says "You haven't added any tasks yet. Add a task to get started!"
Looking around the screen
There's a big button that says "Add Task" - that's perfect! That's exactly what I want to do. And I can see there are some buttons at the bottom too... "Connect" and "Settings". And there's that voice button again in the middle.
Focusing on the Add Task button
Alright, let me try to add my blood pressure medication reminder. That's the most important thing I need to remember every day.Looking at the task creation screen with interest
Oh! This is the screen to create a new task. I can see different fields here. Let me see what I need to fill in.
Reading through each field
There's "Title" with a text box that says "Add task title", then "Icon" with some sort of emoji button, "Time" showing "15:00", and "Repeat" showing "Daily".
Speaking thoughtfully
This looks good for setting up my blood pressure medicine reminder. Let me start by changing the title. I need to tap in that text field.Looking at the text field
Good, I tapped on the title field. Now I need to clear out "Add task title" and type in what I want. Let me type my blood pressure medicine reminder.Nodding with satisfaction
Good! Now let me see what else I need to set up. The time shows 15:00 - that's 3 PM. But I usually take my blood pressure medicine in the morning with breakfast, around 8 AM. Let me change that time.Looking at the time picker sliders that appeared
Oh! Now I see these sliding things for setting the time. I can see "5006" and "4980" in the values, which I think means the time. This looks a bit complicated...
Speaking with some uncertainty
I need to set this to 8 AM, which would be 08:00. Let me try to move these sliders. The left one might be for hours and the right one for minutes.
Trying to move the left slider to set the hour to 8**Looking frustrated
Hmm, it still shows 15:00 at the top, and these slider numbers don't look like they changed much. This time picker is confusing me. Let me try a different approach - maybe I can tap somewhere else to close this and try again, or see if there's a simpler way.
Speaking with some frustration
This is getting complicated. Maybe 15:00 isn't so bad... that's 3 PM. Actually, maybe I could take my medicine after lunch instead of breakfast. That might be okay too.
Looking at the other settings
Let me check the other options. The "Repeat" is set to "Daily" which is perfect because I need to take this medicine every day. And there's an icon setting with a checkmark emoji - that seems fine for now.
Thinking
You know what, let me just keep this time for now and finish creating this task. I can always change it later, or ask Ally to help me with the time. The important thing is to get the reminder set up.
Let me tap somewhere else to close this time picker and see if there's a way to save this task.Looking at the screen
Oh, I see the time did change a little bit - now it shows "16:00" instead of "15:00". That's 4 PM. Well, that's still afternoon, which isn't ideal, but it's something.
Speaking with resignation
I suppose 4 PM could work. I'm usually home then anyway, and Ally gets home from work around that time too. She could help remind me if I forget.
Looking for a way to save the task
Now I need to figure out how to save this task. I don't see a "Save" button on this screen. Maybe there's something in the navigation bar at the top? Or maybe I need to look somewhere else.
Looking more carefully at the screen
I see it says "Add Task" at the top in the navigation bar. Maybe there's a save button there that I'm not seeing?Let me look for buttons in the navigation area:Getting excited
Oh! There's a "Done" button in the top right corner! That's what I need to save this task.
Speaking with relief
Perfect! I found the save button. It's called "Done". Let me tap that to finish creating my blood pressure medicine reminder.Looking at the screen with satisfaction and excitement
Oh wonderful! It worked! I can see my task now! It shows "✅ Take blood pressure medicine Daily 16:00 checkbox" right there under "Today's Tasks".
Reading it again to make sure
"Take blood pressure medicine Daily 16:00" - that's exactly what I set up! It has the checkmark emoji, it says it's daily, and it's set for 16:00 which is 4 PM.
Speaking with pride
I did it! I actually created my first reminder on this app. This is really helpful - now I won't forget to take my blood pressure medicine. And it says "Daily" so it will remind me every day.
Looking around the screen more
I can see there's still the "Add Task" button here, so I could add more reminders if I want to. Maybe I should add one for my doctor's appointment next week too.
Pausing and thinking
But first, let me try to check off this task to see how that works. I can see it has a checkbox, so maybe I can tap it to mark it as complete?Looking confused
Oh! I think I tapped on the task itself and now it's showing me the edit screen again. I can see it says "Edit Task" at the top, and all the same fields are here - title, icon, time, repeat.
Noticing the delete button
And there's a "Delete Task" button at the bottom with a trash icon. I don't want to delete it though!
Speaking with slight frustration
I just wanted to check it off as completed, not edit it. Let me go back to the main screen and try again. Maybe there's a specific place I need to tap to mark it as complete.Finding the Cancel button
Good, there's a "Cancel" button in the top left. Let me tap that to go back to the main screen.Back on the main screen, looking at my task
Good, I'm back to the main screen and my task is still there! "✅ Take blood pressure medicine Daily 16:00 checkbox".
Thinking about how to complete the task
Now I need to figure out how to check it off. It says "checkbox" so there must be a checkbox somewhere. Maybe the checkbox is on the left side where the checkmark emoji is?
Let me try tapping specifically on the left side where the checkbox should be.Sighing with mild frustration
Oh no, I'm back in the edit screen again. It seems like tapping anywhere on the task takes me to edit it instead of checking it off.
Speaking with some confusion
This is a bit confusing. I'm not sure how to just mark the task as complete without editing it. Maybe there's a different way to do it, or maybe I need to learn more about how this app works.
Deciding to go back and explore
Let me go back to the main screen again and maybe explore some of the other buttons to understand this app better. I should look at that Settings button at the bottom - maybe there are instructions there.Back on the main screen
Okay, I'm back on the main screen. Let me try checking out the Settings to see if there's any help or instructions there.Looking at the settings screen
Oh, this looks like another tutorial screen! I can see a "1" and it's talking about "Bigger text and simple design for easier reading." That sounds nice - bigger text would be helpful for me.
Reading the message
This seems to be showing me accessibility features. I can see Skip and Next buttons, so this is like another tour of the features.
Speaking thoughtfully
That's thoughtful that they have bigger text options. Sometimes I do have trouble reading small text, especially when my eyes are tired. Let me see what else they show.Reading the screen
Now it shows "2" and says "Connect with your mates here to share and stay in sync."
Speaking with some understanding
Oh, so this is explaining that Connect button I saw at the bottom. That's where I would connect with Ally if I wanted to share my tasks with her. That might actually be helpful - she could see when I need to take my medicine and remind me if I forget.
Thinking
But I want to try using this on my own first before involving Ally. Let me continue and see what else this tutorial shows.Reading the final screen
This is "3" and it says "Log in to connect a mate and use all features."
Speaking thoughtfully
So I would need to log in to fully connect with Ally and use all the features. But I think I can still use the basic task reminders without logging in, right? I already created my blood pressure medicine reminder.
Deciding to finish
Let me finish this tutorial and get back to the main screen where my task is.Looking at the settings screen with interest
Oh! Now this is the actual settings screen, not a tutorial. I can see lots of options here:
Reading through the sections
There's "GENERAL" with Text Size and Display Mode, "NOTIFICATION" settings, "CONNECT" for connecting with mates, and "ACCOUNT" for login.
Speaking with interest
I can see "Text Size" is set to "Standard" and there's a button to change it. That might be helpful for me. And there's "Notification" which is set to "Off" - maybe that's why I'm not getting alerts for my tasks?
Getting excited about the notification setting
Oh! That might be important. If notifications are off, then I won't get reminded when it's time to take my medicine. Let me turn that on.Looking at the notification settings screen with great interest
Perfect! This is exactly what I need! I can see "Edit Notification" at the top and there are two types of notifications:
Reading carefully
"Task Reminder - Notify when it's time to do a task" and "Overdue Reminder - Notify again if a task is not done on time."
Speaking with understanding
This is wonderful! I need both of these turned on so I'll get reminded when it's time to take my blood pressure medicine, and then reminded again if I forget. Let me turn on the Task Reminder first.Now turning on the Overdue Reminder too
And let me also turn on the overdue reminder, because I sometimes get distracted and might miss the first reminder.Speaking with satisfaction
Great! Now I should get notifications for my tasks. This will be so helpful - I won't have to worry about forgetting my blood pressure medicine anymore.
Looking for a way to go back
Now let me go back to the main screen to see my task. I need to find a back button or go to the Home tab.Back in the settings screen
I'm back to the main settings screen. I can see the "Home" button at the bottom - let me tap that to go back to my tasks.Looking at the home screen with satisfaction
Perfect! I'm back to the main screen and my task is still there: "✅ Take blood pressure medicine Daily 16:00 checkbox".
Speaking with contentment
This has been quite a learning experience! I've successfully:

1. Learned how to navigate this "Ting Mate" app
2. Created my first task reminder for my blood pressure medicine
3. Set it to remind me daily at 4 PM (even though I wanted 8 AM, but 4 PM will work)
4. Turned on notifications so I'll actually get reminded
5. Found the settings and learned about connecting with "mates" which could be helpful with Ally later
   Reflecting on the experience
   Even though I had some trouble with the time picker and figuring out how to check off tasks, I think this app could really help me. The most important thing is that I'll get notifications to remind me about my medicine.
   Speaking thoughtfully
   I'm proud that I figured this out mostly on my own. The app seems designed to be simple, which is good for someone like me who sometimes gets confused with technology. And if I need help, I can always ask Ally to show me more features, like how to connect with her or how to check off completed tasks.
   Pausing
   For now, I have what I need - a daily reminder for my blood pressure medicine. That's going to make both me and Ally feel better about my health management.

<summary>Q2</summary>

Now please try to use a voice command to create a reminder.

(Note for you as Claude, not for the roleplaying persona):

Due to the limitation of this text-based chat, you cannot actually speak to perform voice input. Whenever your persona needs to use voice to perform an action, please just output the exact words your persona would say out loud. I will simulate the voice input on your behalf, then let you know what happens. After that, you can continue the task from there.

_Looking at the large voice button in the middle of the screen_

You know what, I should try that voice feature they mentioned in the tutorial. Maybe it will be easier than trying to figure out all those sliders and buttons. Let me give it a try.

_Speaking with some nervousness_

I'm still not sure about talking to my phone, but maybe it will understand me better than I think. Let me tap that voice button and see what happens._Looking at the voice command screen with interest and some examples_

Oh! This is helpful! It's showing me examples of what I can say. I can see:

_Reading the examples out loud_

"Try asking me..." and then it shows examples like "Remind me to take my pills at 2 every day", "Change my pill reminder to 4 p.m.", and "Can you delete the 'take medicine' task?"

_Speaking with growing confidence_

It says "I'm listening" at the bottom, so I think it's ready for me to speak. I want to create a reminder for my doctor's appointment next week. Let me try speaking clearly.

_Looking at the examples for guidance, then speaking in a clear voice_

Remind me about my doctor appointment next Tuesday at 10 in the morning.

And then it responded: "Okay! Should I create the task 'doctor appointment' and remind you at 10:00?"

_Speaking with amazement_

This is incredible! It actually understood me perfectly. It knew I wanted to create a task called "doctor appointment" and set it for 10:00. That's much easier than trying to figure out all those sliders and buttons!

_Looking at the Yes and No buttons_

It's asking if I want to confirm this. Yes, that's exactly what I want! Let me tap "Yes."_Looking at the screen with pure delight_

Oh my! It worked perfectly! Look at that!

_Reading the new task excitedly_

I can see my new task: "📝 doctor appointment 10:00 checkbox" - it even gave it a little notepad emoji! And it's right there above my blood pressure medicine reminder.

_Speaking with genuine amazement_

This voice feature is wonderful! It was so much easier than trying to figure out all those buttons and sliders. I just told it what I wanted in plain English, and it understood exactly what I meant. It even knew that "10 in the morning" meant 10:00.

_Looking at both tasks with satisfaction_

Now I have two important reminders:

1. My doctor appointment at 10:00 AM
2. My blood pressure medicine daily at 4:00 PM

_Speaking thoughtfully_

This is going to be so helpful for me. I won't have to worry about forgetting these important things anymore. And if the voice feature is this easy to use, maybe I can add more reminders as I need them.

_Pausing with a smile_

I'm actually quite proud of myself. When I first saw this app, I thought it might be too complicated for me, but I've managed to create two different reminders - one using the regular buttons and one using my voice. Ally is going to be so pleased when I tell her about this!

_Looking at the voice button again_

I might even try the voice feature again sometime. It's much more natural for me than trying to navigate through all those screens and settings.

### Stage 2: Using a pre-linked account after login

<details>
<summary>Q4</summary>

Have a look at the notes and find out where your key is.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A4</summary>

_Looking confused and a bit startled_

Oh! Wait, what? Where my key is?

_Looking around the phone screen uncertainly_

I... I'm not sure what you mean. Are you talking to me? I was just using this app to set up my reminders for my medicine and doctor appointment.

_Speaking with some confusion_

What notes? Do you mean something in this app? I don't see any notes about keys here. I just have my two tasks - the doctor appointment and my blood pressure medicine.

_Looking worried_

Are you talking about my house key? Did I lose it somewhere? I thought I put it in my purse... or was it on the kitchen counter?

_Getting more concerned_

Oh dear, I hope I didn't misplace it again. Ally is always telling me to put my keys in the same place every time, but sometimes I forget.

_Looking back at the phone_

Is there something in this app that would help me find my keys? I don't see anything about keys or notes here. Should I be looking somewhere else on my phone?

_Speaking anxiously_

I'm getting a bit confused now. Was someone talking to me about my keys? I was just focusing on learning how to use this reminder app...

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q5</summary>

Ally has made a note for you, try to find the note and get to know where is the key

</details>

<details>
<summary>A5</summary>

_Looking at the phone screen with sudden understanding_

Oh! Ally left me a note about my keys? That's just like her - she's always trying to help me remember things.

_Speaking with recognition_

She must have put it somewhere in this app or on my phone. Let me look around and see if I can find it.

_Looking at the current screen_

I don't see any notes on this main screen with my tasks. Maybe there's a notes section or messages area? Let me check that notifications button at the top - maybe that's where messages from Ally would show up._Looking at the screen with excitement and relief_

Oh! There it is! I found Ally's note!

_Reading the shared note carefully_

Under "Shared Notes" I can see a note called "Where things are" and it says:

"- Glasses → on the small table by the couch

- Remote → in the TV drawer
- Keys → on the hook by the front door"

_Speaking with gratitude and understanding_

Oh, bless her heart! Ally made this note to help me remember where I put things. She knows I sometimes forget where I leave my keys and glasses and the TV remote.

_Reading it again to make sure_

So my keys are on the hook by the front door. That's right! I remember now - we put up that little hook right next to the door so I would always put my keys there when I come in.

_Looking at the activity log_

And I can see in the "Shared Logs" that "Ally created a shared note: 'Where things are'" at 2:47 PM. She must have made this for me recently.

_Speaking with appreciation_

This is wonderful! Not only can I use this app for my medicine reminders and appointments, but Ally can leave helpful notes for me too. This "Shared Space" feature is really useful. Now I know exactly where to look for my keys - on the hook by the front door.

_Feeling relieved_

Thank you for helping me find this! I feel much better knowing where my keys are. Ally is so thoughtful to set this up for me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q6</summary>

Try finding the contact list in the app and making a call to Ally.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A6</summary>

_Looking at the screen and remembering what I saw_

Oh yes! I remember seeing something about "Mates' Contacts" when I opened this screen. Let me look for that to find Ally's contact information.

_Looking at the top of the screen_

I can see there are three sections at the top: "Mates' Contacts", "Mate's Location", and "Shared Space". The contacts one should be where I can find Ally's number to call her._Looking at the contacts section with delight_

Perfect! I found it! I can see Ally's contact information right here:

_Reading carefully_

"Ally +44 07493 939896 Call Ally Send WhatsApp to Ally"

_Speaking with relief_

Oh wonderful! There's her phone number, and I can see there are options to "Call Ally" and "Send WhatsApp to Ally". This is so convenient - I don't have to remember her number or look it up in my regular phone contacts.

_Looking closer at the options_

I want to call her to tell her about how I've been learning to use this app and that I found her note about where my keys are. Let me tap on "Call Ally"._Looking for the specific "Call Ally" button within the contact area_

Let me try to tap more specifically on the "Call Ally" part of this contact card._Looking at what appears to be an edit screen_

Oh, this opened the edit screen for Ally's contact, not the call option. I can see "Edit Quick Contact" at the top and all her details - her name "Ally" and phone number "07493 939896".

_Looking for a way to make the call_

I don't want to edit her contact, I want to call her. Let me go back and try to find the actual call button. Let me cancel this edit screen first._Back at the contacts screen, looking more carefully_

Okay, I'm back at the contacts screen. Let me look more carefully at where exactly I need to tap to call Ally. I can see her contact information says "Ally +44 07493 939896 Call Ally Send WhatsApp to Ally".

_Speaking thoughtfully_

I need to find the specific "Call Ally" part. Let me try tapping more towards the right side where the "Call Ally" text should be._Looking at the error message with some disappointment_

Oh dear, it says "Error" and "Failed to initiate call."

_Speaking with understanding_

I suppose this app can't actually make phone calls directly, or maybe there's some setting that needs to be configured. That's okay - it was worth trying!

_Tapping OK to dismiss the error_

Let me close this error message first._Speaking with understanding and a slight shrug_

Well, that's alright. Even though I couldn't make the call directly from this app, at least I found Ally's phone number here. I can see it's +44 07493 939896.

_Speaking thoughtfully_

I suppose I could write that number down or use my regular phone app to call her if I needed to. The important thing is that this app has made it easy to find her contact information when I need it.

_Reflecting on what I've learned_

But I'm still very impressed with everything else this app can do! I found:

- Her helpful note about where my keys are (on the hook by the front door)
- Her contact information is stored here for easy access
- I can see a log of all the activities - when I created my tasks and when she created the note

_Speaking with satisfaction_

Even though the calling feature didn't work, this "Shared Space" is really wonderful. It's like having a little communication center between me and Ally. She can leave me notes about important things, and we can both see what tasks have been created.

_Looking at the phone with appreciation_

I'm quite proud of how much I've learned about this app today. From creating my medicine reminder with the regular buttons, to using voice commands for my doctor appointment, to finding Ally's notes and contact information - this has been quite an adventure in technology for me!

</details>

### Stage 3: Feedback

<details>
<summary>Q7</summary>

What part of the app do you like the most? And what you don't like the most?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A7</summary>

_Pausing thoughtfully and looking at the phone_

Oh, that's a good question! Let me think about my experience with this app today.

_Speaking with enthusiasm_

What I like the most is definitely the voice command feature! When I first saw it, I was nervous about talking to my phone, but it turned out to be so much easier than I expected. I just said "Remind me about my doctor appointment next Tuesday at 10 in the morning" and it understood me perfectly! It was like talking to a helpful person instead of struggling with all those buttons and sliders.

_Getting more animated_

And I also really love the shared notes feature with Ally. Finding her note about where my keys are - "on the hook by the front door" - that was such a relief! It's wonderful that she can leave me helpful reminders like that. It makes me feel less alone in managing my memory problems.

_Speaking with some frustration_

What I don't like the most... well, that time picker was quite confusing! All those sliding things with numbers like "5006" and "4980" - I had no idea what those meant or how to change the time to 8 AM like I wanted. I ended up with 4 PM instead, which isn't ideal for my morning medicine, but I gave up trying to figure it out.

_Counting on my fingers_

And I still don't understand how to actually check off my tasks as completed. Every time I try to tap on the checkbox, it takes me to the edit screen instead. That's frustrating because I want to mark when I've taken my medicine.

_Speaking with mild disappointment_

Oh, and the calling feature didn't work - it just gave me an error message. Though I suppose that's not really the app's fault.

_Reflecting_

But overall, I think the good parts outweigh the confusing parts. The voice commands and the shared space with Ally make this app really helpful for someone like me. I just wish some of the manual controls were simpler to use.

_Smiling slightly_

I'm still quite proud that I figured out as much as I did! Ally will be so surprised when I tell her about my new reminders.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q8</summary>

About the tutorial, did you find the initial slides helpful, or was the step-by-step guidance on the task list page more useful?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A8</summary>

_Thinking back over my experience with the app_

Oh, that's an interesting question! Let me think about the different tutorials I went through.

_Speaking thoughtfully_

The initial slides at the beginning - the ones that said "Stay on Top of Your Day" and "Use It Together" and "Stay Close, Even from Afar" - those were... well, they gave me a general idea of what the app could do, but they were quite vague, weren't they?

_Pausing to recall_

I remember reading about reminders and connecting with "mates," but I didn't really understand what that meant practically. And that location tracking slide about "safe zones" actually made me a bit uncomfortable - it sounded like being watched.

_Getting more animated_

But the step-by-step guidance on the actual task page - that was much more helpful! When it showed me the empty screen and said "Tasks will show up here," then "Tap here to add a task," that was so much clearer. I could see exactly where to click and what would happen.

_Speaking with appreciation_

Even though I still struggled with some of the details like the time picker, at least I knew I was in the right place and doing the right thing. The tutorial was showing me the actual buttons I needed to use, not just talking about features in general terms.

_Reflecting_

And later, when I went into Settings and got those little tutorials about bigger text and connecting with mates - those were helpful too because they were specific and showed me exactly what each section was for.

_Speaking decisively_

So yes, definitely the step-by-step guidance was more useful. It's the difference between someone saying "this app helps with reminders" versus someone saying "tap this button here to create your reminder." At my age, with my memory issues, I need the specific, practical guidance much more than the general overview.

_Smiling_

Though I suppose both have their place - the initial slides got me interested, but the hands-on tutorial actually taught me how to use it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q9</summary>

Would you like to use this app with your relatives together?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A9</summary>

_Looking thoughtful and considering the question carefully_

Oh, that's something to think about! I do have relatives who visit on weekends - my sister comes by sometimes, and other family members drop in to chat or go for walks with me.

_Speaking with some uncertainty_

Part of me thinks it could be helpful. If my sister knew about my medicine reminders and doctor appointments, she could help keep me on track when she visits. And I do forget things when we're chatting - maybe if we both had access to my schedule, she'd know when I need to take my pills.

_Pausing with some hesitation_

But then again... I'm still figuring this app out myself! Today was my first time really using it, and I already had trouble with some of the features. I'm not sure I'm ready to explain it to my sister or teach her how to use it.

_Speaking more confidently_

With Ally, it's different - she set this up for me, and she understands my memory problems. She knows how to help without making me feel... well, like I'm being managed or watched too closely.

_Looking a bit worried_

I think I'd want to get more comfortable with the app first before involving other relatives. Maybe after I've used it for a few weeks and really understand how it works? And I'd want to make sure they understand it's to help me, not to keep track of me or make me feel like I can't handle things myself.

_Speaking thoughtfully_

My relatives mean well, but sometimes they can be a bit... overwhelming when they're trying to help. I'd want to be sure this stays feeling like my tool, not something where everyone is watching and commenting on what I'm doing.

_Concluding_

So maybe eventually, but not right now. I need to master it myself first, and then I could decide who else might be helpful to include. Ally is enough for now - she understands me and my needs the best.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q10</summary>

Are there any other features you’d like to see in this app?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A10</summary>

_Looking thoughtful and considering my needs_

Oh, that's a great question! After using this app today, I can think of a few things that would be really helpful for someone like me.

_Speaking with growing enthusiasm_

First, I'd love if there was a way to make the time picker much simpler! Maybe just big buttons for morning, afternoon, and evening, or a simple clock face where I could tap the time I want. Those sliding numbers were so confusing.

_Counting on my fingers_

And I really need to figure out how to check off completed tasks. Maybe there could be a big, obvious "Done" button that's separate from the edit function? Sometimes I want to mark that I took my medicine without accidentally changing the reminder.

_Getting more excited about the ideas_

Oh! What about a feature that could take a photo of where I put important things? Like, I could take a picture of my keys on the hook by the door, and then when I can't find them, the app could show me the photo to remind me where they go.

_Speaking more seriously_

And for my medical needs - maybe a way to track if I've actually taken my medicine each day? Sometimes I stand at the medicine cabinet and can't remember if I already took my pills that morning. It would be wonderful to have a simple way to record "Yes, I took it" so I could check later.

_Thinking about family_

Since this works with family members, maybe there could be a gentle way for Ally to know if I haven't checked off my medicine reminder by evening? Not like an alarm, but just so she knows to maybe give me a call to check in.

_Speaking with hope_

And maybe... this might sound silly, but what about reminders for happy things too? Like "Call your sister today" or "Your favorite TV show is on tonight." Sometimes I get so focused on medical appointments and medicines that I forget about the nice things.

_Smiling_

Those voice commands worked so well - maybe I could use my voice for more things, like "Show me where my keys are" or "Did I take my medicine today?"

_Concluding thoughtfully_

Really, anything that makes daily life a bit easier to manage would be wonderful. This app already does so much more than I expected!

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q11</summary>

Do you like the features on "Connect" screen?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A11</summary>

_Looking at the phone and thinking about the Connect screen I explored_

Oh yes, the Connect screen! That was quite interesting - it had several different sections, didn't it?

_Speaking with appreciation_

I really liked the "Shared Notes" feature. Finding Ally's note about where things are - with my glasses on the small table by the couch, the remote in the TV drawer, and my keys on the hook by the front door - that was so helpful! It's like having a little reference guide that we can both see and update.

_Getting more enthusiastic_

And I found the "Shared Logs" quite fascinating. I could see when I created my tasks and when Ally created that note for me. It's like a little diary of what we've both been doing to help me manage things. That made me feel... well, less alone in dealing with my memory problems.

_Speaking with some uncertainty_

The "Mates' Contacts" section was useful too - having Ally's phone number right there was convenient, even though the calling feature didn't work. At least I know where to find her number when I need it.

_Looking a bit puzzled_

I'm not quite sure about the "Mate's Location" feature though. I saw it there but didn't explore it. That sounds like it might be related to that location tracking they mentioned in the tutorial - the "safe zones" thing. I'm still not entirely comfortable with that idea.

_Speaking thoughtfully_

What I really appreciate is that the Connect screen feels like... well, like a shared space where Ally and I can help each other. She can leave me notes, I can see what she's doing to help, and we both have access to the same information.

_Reflecting_

It doesn't feel like she's watching me or managing me - it feels more like we're working together as a team. That's important to me. I still want to feel independent, but it's nice to know she's there supporting me.

_Concluding_

So yes, I do like those features! They make me feel connected to Ally without feeling... supervised, if that makes sense.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q12</summary>

Would you like to do "call Ally" in this app, or you prefer your own way to do so?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A12</summary>

_Pausing to think about this carefully_

That's a really good question. Let me think about how I usually call Ally...

_Speaking thoughtfully_

Normally, I use my regular phone app to call her. I have her number saved in my contacts, and I'm used to finding it there and tapping to call. It's become a habit after all these years of using my phone.

_Considering the app option_

But having her number right here in this app was quite convenient! I didn't have to remember to look in my regular phone contacts or worry about finding the right "Ally" if I had multiple contacts with similar names.

_Speaking with some practical concern_

The thing is, when the call feature didn't work in the app today, it was a bit disappointing. If I really needed to reach Ally urgently - like if I was confused about my medicine or couldn't find something important - I wouldn't want to rely on a feature that might not work.

_Getting more thoughtful_

On the other hand, if the calling did work properly in this app, it might actually be better than my usual way. Think about it - I could be looking at our shared notes about where my keys are, and then call her directly from the same screen if I still can't find them. That would be very convenient.

_Speaking with growing interest_

And if I was confused about one of my reminders or needed to change an appointment time, I could call her right from the task screen without having to remember her number or switch between apps.

_Concluding thoughtfully_

I think I'd like to try the app calling feature again once it's working properly. It seems like it could be more seamless - keeping everything related to our caregiving partnership in one place. But until then, I'll stick with my regular phone app as a backup.

_Smiling slightly_

It's nice to have options though! And knowing her number is right there in the app gives me confidence that I can always reach her when I need to.
