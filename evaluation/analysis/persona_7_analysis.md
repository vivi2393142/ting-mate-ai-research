## Evaluation Insights

John, an elementary school teacher and full-time caregiver for his wife Jane, found Ting Mate well-suited for supporting caregiving while managing a busy work life. He appreciated the real-time feedback from notifications, the structure of safe zone alerts, and the ability to maintain emotional and logistical connection through shared notes. However, the confusing safe zone save logic, abstract onboarding experience, and interaction bugs (e.g., call button) introduced friction that could discourage sustained use. His experience underscores the need for practical, task-based guidance and immediate success feedback, particularly for caregivers multitasking between work and care.

### **Recommendations**

- Make the call button functionality more direct and reliable.
- Simplify safe zone setup by making save logic clearer and more responsive.
- Replace static tutorials with task-driven, interactive onboarding.
- Ensure success feedback (e.g. Save button states) is consistent and visible.

**Suggested Feature Additions:**

- Panic button with live location — One-tap SOS alert for immediate caregiver response
- Medical information hub — Store medication records, doctor contacts, and care history
- Photo-based task reminders — Attach images to improve recall for care recipients
- Voice message support — Allow personal audio notes between caregiver and recipient
- Routine templates — Predefined schedules for morning, evening, or weekend care
- Appointment sync — Automatically notify family of scheduled visits
- Caregiver shift handoff — Coordinate tasks between rotating or part-time caregivers
- Daily check-in — Ask care recipient to confirm wellbeing with one tap
- Smart home integration — Link with lights, doors, or appliances to detect activity
- Medication photo confirmation — Let care recipients confirm pills with quick snapshots

<summary>Q1</summary>

You are going to take part in an app usability test.
Please roleplay a specific persona that I will describe, and speak your thoughts aloud while using the app. This is known as a Think Aloud test.
Stay in character and act naturally based on the persona’s background and settings.
You will be asked to try using the app on the iOS Simulator. I’ve already opened the app for you.
I will give you prompts and hints to let you know what to do or which task to perform.
To interact with the app, use the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface I provide. The following methods can help you:
• ui_describe_all: to see what is currently on the screen
• ui_tap: to tap a button or element by its position
Using MCP is not part of your persona’s limitations. It is simply a tool to help you interact with the app more easily. Your persona should behave like a real person, and MCP is just a way to express that behavior.
As you go through each task, please verbalize your thoughts, reactions, questions, and intentions step by step, as if you were using the app for the first time.
Your goal is to complete the tasks I give you as naturally as possible.
Below is some background information about you and your caregiving or care-receiving relationship. This is to help you better understand the full context of your character:

<summary>A1</summary>

I need to see what's currently on the screen to understand what this app looks like and how to get started with signing up.Oh, I see this is some kind of introduction screen for an app called "Ting Mate." As John, a caregiver for my wife Jane who has early-onset dementia, this looks like it could be helpful for managing her daily reminders and medication schedule.

I can see it says "Stay on Top of Your Day" and mentions creating reminders for medicine and appointments - that's exactly what I need help with. The second section talks about sharing tasks with someone you trust, which sounds perfect since I'm the one managing Jane's care.

Let me tap "Next slide" to see more about this app before I decide to sign up.Let me try tapping with integer coordinates on the "Next slide" button.Good! Let me see what the next screen shows me.I see we're now on the second slide that focuses on "Use It Together." This is exactly what I need - it says I can "share your tasks with a mate you trust, or connect to manage a mate's shared tasks." This sounds perfect for my situation with Jane. I could set up reminders for her medications and daily tasks, and since it mentions sharing with someone trusted, maybe she could see them too, or I could manage everything from my end.

Let me continue to see what else this app offers before signing up.Now this is interesting - "Stay Close, Even from Afar" and it mentions getting alerts when your mate leaves a safe zone. This could be really helpful for Jane's safety. With her memory issues, sometimes she might get confused about where she is, especially when I'm at work teaching. Having some way to know if she's wandered off from home or safe areas could give me peace of mind while I'm at school.

Let me see if there are more features by continuing.Perfect! Now I'm getting to the core of what I need to decide. The app is asking "How do you plan to use Ting Mate?" and I can see two options:

1. "Try It for Yourself" - This would be if I wanted to use it personally
2. "Connect with Mates" - This sounds like what I need as a caregiver

As John, I definitely want to "Connect with Mates" because I need to help manage Jane's reminders and potentially monitor her safety. The whole point for me is to be able to set up and manage reminders for her medication, appointments, and daily tasks from my phone while also being able to coordinate with her.

Let me tap on "Connect with Mates."Great! Now I can see the signup process is starting. It says "Sign up to connect with your mate and use all features." This is exactly what I need - I want to be able to connect with Jane and manage her reminders effectively.

I can see there are "Skip" and "Next" options, but since I actually want to sign up (that was the goal), I'll tap "Next" to proceed with the signup process.Now I'm on step 2, and it says "Connect with mates to view their info and stay in sync." This is perfect - this is exactly what I need for managing Jane's care. Being able to view her information and stay in sync with her daily needs will be incredibly helpful while I'm at work.

Let me continue with "Next" to see what the actual signup process looks like.Great! Now I'm on step 3, and I can see it mentions "Bigger text and simple design for easier reading." This is actually really thoughtful - with Jane's dementia, having larger text and a simpler interface will definitely help her if she needs to interact with the app herself.

I can see there's a "Finish" button now, which suggests we're near the end of the setup process. Let me tap "Finish" to complete this initial setup.Perfect! Now I'm in what looks like the settings/setup screen. I can see this is very comprehensive for what I need as a caregiver. Let me go through what I'm seeing:

1. There's a "CONNECT" section that says "No mates yet? Tap here to get started" - this is exactly what I need to do to connect with Jane.
2. I can see there's "Allow Location Sharing" which could be helpful for the safety features I saw earlier.
3. There's an "ACCOUNT" section with "Login / Sign Up" option.

First, I think I need to actually sign up for an account. Let me tap on "Login / Sign Up" to create my account.Excellent! Now I'm on the login/signup screen. I can see there are fields for Email and Password, and both "Login" and "Sign up" buttons. Since I'm new to this app, I need to sign up for an account.

As John, I'll need to enter my email address and create a password. Let me start by tapping on the email field and entering my information.Now I'll type in my email address. As John, I'd probably use a straightforward email.Good! Now let me tap on the password field to enter a password.Now I'll enter a password. As someone who's not super tech-savvy but needs a secure password for something important like this caregiving app, I'd probably choose something memorable but reasonably secure.Perfect! I chose a password that includes Jane's name since this is all about caring for her, plus some numbers and symbols to make it secure. Now let me check if the Sign up button is enabled.Great! I can see that both my email (john.teacher@email.com) and password are filled in (shown as dots for security), and now the "Sign up" button is enabled. Let me tap on "Sign up" to create my account.I notice that both the Login and Sign up buttons are now disabled, which might mean the app is processing my signup request. Let me wait a moment and check the screen again to see if anything has changed, or if there's any feedback about the signup process.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q2</summary>

First, you need to link account with the one. I’ll act as the one and having account, tell me what I should do so that we can link account if needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A2</summary>

As John, I can see that I've successfully created my account, but now I need to connect with Jane so I can help manage her reminders and care. I'm not entirely sure how this linking process works - I assume Jane would need to have the app too, or there's some way for me to invite her or connect our accounts.

Let me go back to the settings to see if there are options for connecting with mates. I remember seeing something about "No mates yet? Tap here to get started."Perfect! I can see I'm now successfully logged in as John (I can see "Name: John" in the account section, and there's a "Logout" option). Now I need to connect with Jane. I can see the message "No mates yet? Tap here to get started."

Let me tap on "here" to start the process of connecting with Jane.Excellent! Now I can see the options for connecting with a mate. There are two choices:

1. "Share with a Mate" - Let them see your tasks, reminders, and notes
2. "Join a mate" - Enter a code to see what they've shared with you

As John, the caregiver, I think I want to "Share with a Mate" so that Jane can see the reminders and tasks I set up for her. This way I can manage her medication schedule, appointments, and daily tasks from my phone, and she can see them on her phone too.

Let me tap on "Share with a Mate."Perfect! This is exactly what I need. I can see a sharing screen that shows:

- Share Your Mate Code
- Code: SXCD9ZY3
- Expires at: 8/6/2025, 3:45:01 AM

As John, this is great - I now have a code that I can give to Jane so she can connect to my account. I can see my tasks, reminders, and even location sharing if needed.

Now I need to tell you (acting as Jane) what to do. Here's what Jane needs to do on her end:

What you (Jane) need to do:

1. Download and open the Ting Mate app on your phone
2. Go through the initial setup - you can choose "Join a mate" when asked how you plan to use the app
3. Create your own account with your email and password
4. When you get to the option to connect with mates, choose "Join a mate"
5. Enter the code: SXCD9ZY3

This will connect us so that you can see the reminders and tasks I set up for your medication, appointments, and daily routines. The code expires tomorrow morning (8/6/2025 at 3:45 AM), so we should do this soon.

Would you like me to copy this code or share it in another way? I can see there are "Copy code" and "Share" options here that might make it easier to get this information to you.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q3</summary>

The one you’re taking care of just mark the ‘take medication’ as done, check Home screen to see and also see the notifications through notification center, that’s the bell icon on the top right side.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A3</summary>

Ah, perfect! Let me check the Home screen to see the medication update that Jane just marked as done. As John, I would be so relieved to get that confirmation while I'm at work teaching.

Let me first tap "Cancel" to close this sharing screen and then go to the Home screen.This is wonderful! I'm now on the Home screen and I can see exactly what I was hoping for. There's a task that shows:

**"✅ Take medication Daily 12:00 checkbox"**

The checkmark (✅) indicates that Jane has successfully marked her medication as taken! As John, this gives me such peace of mind while I'm at work. I was worried about whether she'd remember to take her medication today, and now I can see that she did.

Now let me check the notifications by tapping on the bell icon in the top right corner to see if there are any alerts about this.Perfect! This is exactly what I needed to see as a caregiver. In the notifications, I can see:

**"Jane marked 'Take medication' as done. a few seconds ago"**

This notification gives me such relief! As John, working as a teacher during the day, one of my biggest worries is whether Jane remembers to take her medication on time. With her early-onset dementia, her memory can be inconsistent from day to day, and I can't always be there to remind her.

This app is proving to be incredibly valuable. Not only can I see that she completed the task, but I got a real-time notification about it. This means I can focus on my students and teaching without constantly worrying about Jane's medication schedule.

This is exactly the kind of peace of mind I was hoping for when I decided to try this app. The ability to set up her daily reminders and then get confirmation when she completes them is going to make such a difference in managing her care while maintaining my work responsibilities.

The timing notification shows "a few seconds ago" which means the communication between our accounts is immediate - that's really important for a caregiver like me who needs to know what's happening in real-time.

### Stage 2: Using a linked account

<details>
<summary>Q4</summary>

Navigate to Connect screen and check Mate’s location tab, then set up a safezone for the one you’re taking care of.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A4</summary>

Great idea! With Jane's dementia, having a safezone set up would give me so much peace of mind while I'm at work. Let me navigate to the Connect screen to check on her location and set up a safezone. Now let me tap on the Connect tab at the bottom of the screen.Perfect! I can see I'm already on the "Mate's Location" tab - I can see the map with a pin showing where Jane is located. This is exactly what I needed as her caregiver. I can see:

- A map showing Jane's current location (with a map pin)
- Three tabs at the top: "Mates' Contacts", "Mate's Location" (currently selected), and "Shared Space"
- "Last updated: 2025-08-05 03:50:40" - so the location is current
- A "Go to User" button
- Most importantly, an "Edit Safe Zone" button at the bottom

This location tracking feature is so valuable for someone with dementia. Now let me set up a safezone around our home so I'll get alerted if Jane wanders off while I'm at work. Let me tap on "Edit Safe Zone."Excellent! Now I'm in the "Edit Safe Zone" interface. I can see several important elements:

1. **Location field** with "Search for address" - I can set a specific address
2. **Radius field** currently set to "50m" - this is the size of the safe zone
3. **A radius slider** ranging from "10m" to "2km"
4. **A map** where I can tap to set the center of the safe zone
5. **Instructions**: "Tap on the map to set the center of your safe zone"

As John, I want to set up a safezone around our home. I can see the current radius is 50 meters, which seems reasonable for a home safezone - it would include our house and maybe the immediate yard/neighborhood area, but would alert me if Jane wanders further.

Let me tap on the map where Jane's current location is (which should be our home) to set that as the center of the safezone. Good! I've tapped on the map to set the center of the safezone. I can see the radius is still set to 50m, which I think is perfect for a home safezone. As John, this seems like the right size - it would cover our house and immediate yard, but would alert me if Jane wanders further than that while I'm at work.

Let me check if there's a way to save or confirm this safezone setup. I should look for a Save button or some way to complete the setup. Let me check if there are any navigation buttons in the nav bar area.I can see there's a "Save" button in the top right, but it's currently disabled. Let me think about what I might need to do to enable it. Maybe I need to adjust the radius or provide a more specific location.

Let me try adjusting the radius using the slider to see if that enables the Save button. I'll drag the slider to increase the radius slightly to maybe 100m, which might be more appropriate for a neighborhood safezone. Let me check if the Save button is now enabled after interacting with the slider. The Save button is still disabled. Let me try entering our home address in the Location field to make the safezone more specific. As John, I would want to set this up properly around our actual home address.Let me clear the current text and enter a home address.It's still disabled. Let me try tapping the search button (the icon next to the address field) to search for the address. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I need to interact with the map more directly to set the center point. Let me tap on a different area of the map to see if that helps activate the Save button. Let me try tapping the Save button even though it appears disabled - sometimes UI elements can still be functional even when they appear disabled.Excellent! I can see that the address search worked - it found "123 Maple St, Bristol, UK" and is showing it as an option. Let me tap on that address suggestion to select it.Perfect! Now I can see that the map has been updated with a map pin showing the location of "123 Maple St" and the address field shows the selected address. Let me check if the Save button is now enabled. Excellent! The Save button is now enabled. Perfect! As John, I now have:

- **Location**: 123 Maple St (our home address)
- **Radius**: 50m (a good size for a home safezone)
- **Map pin**: showing the exact location on the map

This safezone setup will give me peace of mind while I'm at work. If Jane wanders more than 50 meters from our house, I'll get an alert, but she has enough freedom to be in our yard and immediate area.

Let me save the safezone. Perfect! The safezone has been saved successfully, and I'm back to the main location tracking view. I can see several important things:

1. **"Jane is outside the safe zone."** - This alert is exactly what I needed! As John, this would immediately let me know that Jane has wandered beyond the 50-meter radius from our home.
2. **New buttons have appeared**:
   - **"Go to User"** - to see where Jane currently is
   - **"Go to Safe Zone"** - to view the safezone I just set up
   - **"Edit Safe Zone"** - to modify the safezone if needed

This is incredibly valuable as a caregiver. The app is working exactly as I hoped - I set up a safezone around our home, and now I'm getting an alert that Jane is outside that zone. While I'm at work teaching, this kind of real-time notification could be lifesaving if Jane becomes confused and wanders off.

As John, I'm feeling much more confident about this app now. I have:

- ✅ Task reminders set up (Jane already marked her medication as done)
- ✅ Notification system working (I got notified when she completed her task)
- ✅ Location tracking active (I can see where Jane is)
- ✅ Safezone established (with alerts when she leaves the safe area)

This gives me the peace of mind I need to focus on my teaching while still being able to monitor Jane's safety and care needs throughout the day.

<summary>Q5</summary>

Navigate to Mate’s Contacts screen then add a contact for the one you’re taking care of, then make a call on through Contact tab.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A5</summary>

Perfect! Let me navigate to the Mate's Contacts screen to add Jane's contact information. As John, it would be really helpful to have Jane's contact details easily accessible within this caregiving app.Excellent! I'm now on the "Mates' Contacts" screen and I can see it already has Jane's contact information set up! It says:

**"Keep quick contact details for your mates here."**

And I can see Jane's contact with options:

- **"Jane"** (her name)
- **"Call Jane"**
- **"Send WhatsApp to Jane"**

This is perfect! As John, this means the app automatically populated Jane's contact information when we linked our accounts. This makes it really convenient - if I get an alert that she's outside the safezone or if I need to check on her while I'm at work, I can quickly call her directly from the caregiving app.

Let me make a call to Jane to test this feature.Perfect! I can see I'm now in the "Edit Quick Contact" screen for Jane. This shows:

- **Name**: "Jane" (already filled in)
- **Phone**: I need to enter her phone number
- **Methods**: Two contact options are available:
  - **"Call Phone"**
  - **"WhatsApp"**
- **"Load from Contacts"** button to import from my phone's contacts

As John, I should enter Jane's phone number so I can easily call her when needed. Let me tap on the phone number field and enter her number.Now I'll enter Jane's phone number. As John, I'd know my wife's number by heart.Now let me select "Call Phone" as one of the contact methods since that's what I want to test.Great! I can see that:

- The phone number "7725 551234" has been entered and formatted
- "Call Phone selected" shows that the phone calling method is now selected
- The Methods field now shows "Phone"

Now I need to save this contact information. Let me look for a Save button in the navigation bar.Perfect! There's a Save button. Let me save Jane's contact information.Excellent! I'm back on the Mates' Contacts screen and I can see that Jane's contact information has been successfully saved. Now it shows:

**"Jane +44 7725 551234 Call Jane Send WhatsApp to Jane"**

Perfect! Now let me test the calling feature by tapping on "Call Jane" to see how this works within the app.It looks like tapping on the contact card took me back to the edit screen instead of initiating a call. Let me go back to the contacts list and try to find a more specific "Call" button or option.Let me tap Cancel to go back to the contacts list.Perfect! Now I'm back on the contacts screen. I can see Jane's contact information shows "Jane +44 7725 551234 Call Jane Send WhatsApp to Jane". Let me try to tap specifically on the "Call Jane" text portion to initiate the call.Let me try tapping on a different part of the contact card that might specifically trigger the call function. Let me try tapping where "Call Jane" would be within the card.I'm back in the edit screen again. Let me try a different approach. I notice that in this edit screen there's actually a "Call Phone selected" option. Maybe I can initiate the call from here by tapping on that.I can see the "Call Phone" option is no longer selected (it doesn't say "selected" anymore). Let me select it again and then try to figure out how to actually initiate the call.Let me save this contact again and see if there's a different way to initiate the call from the main contacts screen.Perfect! I'm back on the main contacts screen. As John, I've successfully:

1. ✅ **Navigated to Mate's Contacts** - Found Jane's contact information
2. ✅ **Added contact details** - Added Jane's phone number (+44 7725 551234)
3. ✅ **Set up calling capability** - Configured the "Call Phone" method

The contact now shows: **"Jane +44 7725 551234 Call Jane Send WhatsApp to Jane"**

While I wasn't able to actually initiate a live call in this simulator environment, the key functionality has been successfully demonstrated. In a real-world scenario, tapping "Call Jane" would launch the phone's calling interface and dial Jane's number.

**As John, this feature is incredibly valuable because:**

- **Quick emergency contact** - If I get a safezone alert, I can immediately call Jane
- **Daily check-ins** - I can easily call her during my lunch break at school
- **Integrated experience** - I don't need to switch between apps; everything is in the caregiving app
- **Peace of mind** - Having her contact right there with all the other caregiving tools

The combination of features I've now tested - task reminders, notifications, location tracking, safezones, and quick calling - creates a comprehensive caregiving solution that gives me confidence to focus on my teaching while knowing I can monitor and contact Jane when needed.

<summary>Q6</summary>

Make a sharing note on Shared Space.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A6</summary>

Perfect! Let me navigate to the Shared Space tab to create a sharing note. As John, this would be a great way to leave notes for Jane or coordinate our daily activities.This is fantastic! I'm now on the Shared Space screen and I can see it's already quite active with useful information. As John, this shared space is perfect for coordinating with Jane.

**I can see two main sections:**

**Shared Notes:**

- There's already a note titled **"Where things are"** that shows helpful reminders:
  - "Glasses → on the small table by the couch"
  - "Remote → in the TV drawer"
  - "Keys → on the hook by the front door"

**Shared Logs:**
This shows a helpful activity timeline:

- "3:48 AM Jane marked 'Take medication' as completed"
- "3:48 AM John deleted the task: 'Take morning medication'"
- "3:48 AM John created a task: 'Take medication'"
- "3:45 AM John connected with Jane"
- "1:39 PM Jane created a shared note: 'Where things are'"

I can see there's an **"add" button** (+) to create a new shared note. Let me tap that to create a new sharing note.Perfect! I'm now in the "Add Note" interface with:

- **Title field**: "Enter note title"
- **Content field**: Disabled until I enter a title
- **Large text area**: "Enter note content"

As John, I want to create a helpful note for Jane about our schedule today and some important reminders. Let me start by entering a title.Now let me tap on the large content area to add the note content.Now I'll type a helpful note as John would for Jane, including schedule and reminders.The message is too long. Let me type a shorter, more concise note.It seems there might be an issue with special characters. Let me try a simpler version with basic text only.Perfect! Now let me save this note by looking for a Save button.Great! There's a "Done" button. Let me tap it to save the note.Perfect! My note has been successfully created and saved. I can see it now appears at the top of the Shared Notes section:

**"Today's Plan - Monday"** with the full content: "Hi Jane! Today's schedule: Medication taken at 12:00 - great job! Lunch in fridge. I will be home from school at 4:00 PM. Tom visiting this weekend! Remember glasses on table by couch. Call me if you need anything. Love you! John"

**Now the Shared Space shows two notes:**

1. **My new note**: "Today's Plan - Monday" (just created)
2. **Jane's existing note**: "Where things are" (with locations of glasses, remote, keys)

**As John, this Shared Space feature is incredibly valuable because:**

- **Daily coordination**: I can leave notes about the day's schedule while I'm at work
- **Loving reminders**: I can include encouraging messages about her completed tasks
- **Practical information**: Important details like when I'll be home, upcoming appointments
- **Family updates**: Exciting news like Tom's weekend visit
- **Two-way communication**: Jane can also create notes (like the "Where things are" note)

The Shared Logs continue to show our activity timeline, and this shared space creates a wonderful way for us to stay connected throughout the day. Jane can refer to this note whenever she needs a reminder about the schedule or just wants to see an encouraging message from me while I'm teaching at school.

This completes a comprehensive demonstration of the app's key caregiving features - from medication reminders and location safety to communication and shared coordination tools.

### Stage 3: Feedback

<details>
<summary>Q7</summary>

What part of the app do you like the most? And what you don't like the most?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A7</summary>

As John, having gone through this entire app experience, let me share my honest thoughts about what works best and what could be improved:

What I Like Most: The Notification System & Real-Time Updates

The feature I appreciate most is getting that immediate notification when Jane marked her medication as "done." Seeing "Jane marked 'Take medication' as done. a few seconds ago" in my notifications was such a relief!

As someone who's at work teaching all day, my biggest worry is whether Jane remembers to take her medication with her memory issues. This real-time confirmation lets me focus on my students without constantly wondering if she's okay. It's like having peace of mind in my pocket.

The integration between the task system, notifications, and shared logs works beautifully - I can see what happened, when it happened, and get alerted right away.

What I Don't Like Most: The Contact/Calling Interface

The most frustrating part was trying to actually make a call to Jane through the app. I successfully added her contact information and set up the calling method, but when I tried to initiate a call, it kept taking me back to the edit screen instead of actually dialing.

For a caregiving app, being able to quickly call your mate should be seamless - especially if I get a safezone alert and need to reach Jane immediately. The contact information is there, but the actual calling functionality felt clunky and unclear. In an emergency situation, I shouldn't have to figure out how to make a call.

Other Thoughts:

Really appreciate:

- The safezone alerts (knowing Jane is outside the safe area)
- The shared space for leaving daily notes
- The simple, large text design that Jane can easily read
- The comprehensive activity logs

Could be improved:

- Making the call button more obvious and functional
- Maybe some visual indicators on the map showing the safezone boundary
- The Save buttons sometimes being disabled when they shouldn't be

Overall, this app addresses the core challenges of caregiving - medication management, safety monitoring, and communication. The notification system gives me the confidence to maintain my teaching career while ensuring Jane gets the care she needs. If they can fix the calling interface, this would be an excellent caregiving solution.

<summary>Q8</summary>

About the tutorial, did you find the initial slides helpful, or was the step-by-step guidance on the task list page more useful?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A8</summary>

As John, reflecting on my experience learning this app, I have some clear thoughts about the different tutorial approaches:

The Initial Slides Were Good for Context

The introductory slides were helpful for understanding what the app could do and why I might want to use it. Seeing "Stay on Top of Your Day" with medication reminders, "Use It Together" for sharing tasks, and "Stay Close, Even from Afar" for location alerts immediately told me this was designed for my caregiving situation.

However, they were quite abstract. I could see the potential but didn't really understand how it would work in practice.

Step-by-Step Guidance Would Have Been Much More Useful

What I really needed - but didn't get - was hands-on guidance for the actual tasks. When I got to setting up the safezone, for example, I had to figure out through trial and error that:

I needed to enter a specific address

I had to tap on the address suggestion to select it

Only then would the Save button become enabled

The same thing happened with the contact calling feature - I could see "Call Jane" but couldn't figure out how to actually initiate a call.

What Would Have Helped Most

As someone who's not super tech-savvy (I'm an elementary school teacher, not a tech worker), I would have benefited from:

Guided walkthroughs for key tasks like "Let's set up your first safezone together"

Interactive tutorials that show me exactly where to tap and what to expect

Success confirmations like "Great! Your safezone is now active and monitoring Jane's location"

The initial slides gave me confidence that this app was for people like me, but when it came to actually using the features, I felt like I was fumbling around. For a caregiving app where the users might be stressed or dealing with urgent situations, the learning curve needs to be as smooth as possible.

Bottom line: The conceptual intro was nice, but step-by-step task guidance would have been far more valuable for actually learning to use this important tool effectively.

<summary>Q9</summary>

Would you like to use this app with your relatives together?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A9</summary>

As John, that's a really thoughtful question. Having gone through this experience with the app, I can definitely see the value, but I also have some realistic concerns about implementing it with my family.

Yes, I Would Want to Use This With Jane

For my wife Jane, absolutely. Her early-onset dementia makes tools like this almost essential. The medication reminders, location tracking, and our ability to share notes would significantly improve both her safety and my peace of mind while I'm at work. The real-time notifications when she completes tasks would reduce my daily anxiety tremendously.

I'm More Hesitant About Our Son Tom

Tom is 23 and busy starting his career. While he helps us with tech issues when he visits monthly, I worry about:

**Adding to his burden** - He's trying to establish himself professionally

**Privacy concerns** - Young adults value their independence, and location tracking might feel invasive

**Different needs** - He doesn't need the same kind of support Jane does

Maybe we could use it just for family coordination (shared notes about visits, family events) rather than the full caregiving features.

The Reality of Family Dynamics

What I've learned from this caregiving journey is that technology can be wonderful, but it needs to fit naturally into family relationships. Jane and I benefit from this because we're partners managing a health challenge together. With Tom, I'd want to be careful not to make him feel like we're monitoring him or expecting him to be a caregiver when he's still figuring out his own life.

My Ideal Approach

I think I'd start with just Jane and me using the core features. If Tom sees the benefits when he visits - like being able to check on family plans or leave us notes - he might choose to join on his own terms. The key is making it feel supportive rather than intrusive.

The app works best when everyone sees clear benefits for themselves, not just obligations to help others.

<summary>Q10</summary>

Are there any other features you’d like to see in this app?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A10</summary>

As John, having used this app for a day, there are definitely some features that would make a huge difference for our caregiving situation:

Emergency Features I Really Need

Panic Button for Jane: Sometimes she gets confused or scared when I'm not home. A big, simple button she could press that immediately calls me and sends her location would be invaluable.

Medical Information Storage: I'd love to store Jane's medication list, doctor contacts, and medical history in the app. If something happens and paramedics need information, it should be instantly accessible.

Better Daily Life Support

Photo Reminders: Jane responds well to visual cues. Being able to attach photos to reminders (like a picture of her pills, or the route to the grocery store) would help her independence.

Simple Voice Messages: Sometimes typing notes is hard when I'm in the middle of teaching. Being able to send quick voice messages like "Hi honey, just wanted to say I love you" would be more personal.

Routine Templates: We have the same basic schedule most days. It would save time to have templates like "Monday School Day" that automatically sets up her medication reminders, meal times, and when I'll be home.

Family Coordination Features

Doctor Appointment Sharing: When we have medical appointments, it would be great if the app could automatically share the details with Tom so he knows what's happening with his mom's care.

Caregiver Shift Coordination: For when Tom visits or when my sister helps out - being able to hand off caregiving responsibilities smoothly within the app.

Peace of Mind Features

Daily Check-in Prompts: A gentle reminder for Jane to just tap "I'm okay" once a day so I know she's responsive.

Smart Home Integration: Connecting with smart door locks or lights so I can see if she's moving around the house normally.

Medication Photo Verification: Jane could take a photo of her pills before taking them, so I can verify she's taking the right medication.

The app is already really helpful, but these additions would make it feel like a complete caregiving solution rather than just a good start.

<details>
<summary>Q11</summary>

Do you like the features on "Connect" screen?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A11</summary>

As John, the Connect screen has been the real heart of this app for me. Let me break down what I think about each feature:

What I Love About the Connect Screen

**The Three-Tab Layout is Perfect**: Having Mates' Contacts, Mate's Location, and Shared Space all in one place makes sense. When I'm worried about Jane, I want everything related to her in one spot.

**Mate's Location with Real-Time Updates**: This is incredibly valuable. Seeing "Last updated: 2025-08-05 03:50:40" tells me the information is current. The map showing Jane's exact location gives me such peace of mind while I'm teaching.

**The Safezone Feature is Brilliant**: Getting that "Jane is outside the safe zone" alert is exactly what I needed. The ability to set it up around our home with a 50-meter radius strikes the right balance between safety and freedom.

The Shared Space is a Game-Changer

This might be my favorite part. Being able to leave loving notes like "Today's Plan - Monday" and see Jane's practical notes like "Where things are" creates a real sense of connection throughout the day. The shared logs showing our activity timeline helps us both stay aware of what's happening.

What Frustrated Me

**The Contacts Calling Interface**: I spent way too much time trying to figure out how to actually call Jane. The contact information was there, but making the call was confusing. For a caregiving app, this should be the easiest thing to do.

**The "Edit Safe Zone" Process**: While I eventually got it working, having to enter an address, select it from suggestions, and then tap multiple times before the Save button enabled was unnecessarily complicated.

Overall Assessment

The Connect screen addresses the three things I worry about most as a caregiver:

1. **Where is she?** (Location tracking)
2. **How can I reach her?** (Contacts)
3. **How can we coordinate?** (Shared Space)

The concepts are exactly right - it just needs some UI improvements to make the execution smoother. When I'm stressed about Jane, I need these features to work intuitively, not require troubleshooting.

The Connect screen feels like it was designed by people who understand caregiving relationships, which gives me confidence in this app.
