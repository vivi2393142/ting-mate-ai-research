| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | This voice command feature is actually much easier than trying to figure out those sliders and buttons!                                                                                                                                                                                             | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | For someone my age with these old fingers, being able to just speak naturally... that's quite remarkable really.                                                                                                                                                                                    | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | And those time sliders! Good grief, what a confusing mess. I spent several minutes trying to change 6 PM to 7 PM and couldn't figure it out.                                                                                                                                                        | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | In my day, you had simple number buttons - much more straightforward than these modern gesture things.                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY             |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | And I appreciate that the reminders show up clearly on the main screen. I can see both my tasks right there.                                                                                                                                                                                        | PF_CLEAR_TASK_DISPLAY                 |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | The icons help too, though I'm not sure why one has a checkmark and the other has a notepad.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID           |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | But what I absolutely do NOT like is all that business about tracking where I go and sending "alerts" when I leave some "safe zone."                                                                                                                                                                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I'm 85 years old, not 5. I don't need anyone monitoring my every move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I don't need anyone getting "alerts" about where I go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Anywhere I tap on that task seems to bring me to the editing page instead of marking it complete.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | You know, this is one of those technology problems that drives me crazy. In the real world, when you have a checklist, you just put a checkmark next to the item when you've done it. Simple!                                                                                                       | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | That step-by-step guidance was much more useful! That showed me exactly where to look and what to do.                                                                                                                                                                                               | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Those initial slides made me want to turn the whole thing off before I even got started.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Show me how to use it, don't try to convince me I need features I don't want.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | This shared note feature might be one of the more practical things about this app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | If my daughter-in-law or daughter can help me keep track of where important things are supposed to go, that could save me a lot of time.                                                                                                                                                            | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Maybe it could even help me remember people's birthdays or anniversaries. My memory for dates isn't what it used to be.                                                                                                                                                                             | FS_CALENDAR_REMINDERS                 | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | But I want to be very clear - I mean simple reminders that I set up myself. Not anything that connects to the internet to look up information about me.                                                                                                                                             | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | FS_SIMPLE_REMINDERS                    |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | Just a personal assistant for my own schedule and tasks. That's what would be most helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | FS_SIMPLE_REMINDERS                   |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I want to use this for my own reminders - my vitamins, my television programs, maybe remembering which day the grocery store has sales.                                                                                                                                                             | FS_SIMPLE_REMINDERS                   |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | My family can keep calling me every day like they always have. That's enough connection for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | AFI_EXISTING_COMMUNICATION_SUFFICIENT |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | So voice commands - excellent. Location tracking - absolutely not. That's my assessment.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I suppose I like the practical, helpful features - the shared notes and contact information. But I'm still wary of the surveillance aspects.                                                                                                                                                        | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | If I could use just the useful parts without feeling like I'm being monitored, that would be ideal.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | FS_SELECTIVE_FEATURE_USE               |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | And I can see the value in having quick access to contact information for important people like Lily. Once I figured out how to use it, being able to call her directly from the app could be convenient.                                                                                           | PF_CONTACT_ACCESS                     |                                        |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | I think I'd prefer to keep calling my daughter the way I always have - with my regular phone, privately, without it being tracked or logged or shared with anyone else.                                                                                                                             | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_EXISTING_COMMUNICATION_SUFFICIENT  |                                      |
| Mr. Chang     | Carereceiver | There's a "Done" button on the right side. Perfect! Let me tap that to save this task.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_BUTTON_DISCOVERABILITY            |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The voice command feature is absolutely wonderful! Being able to just say "Remind me about my doctor's appointment on Friday at 10 AM" and have it understand me perfectly - that's amazing.                                                                                                        | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | It's so much easier than trying to navigate through all those menus and remember which buttons to press. Sometimes when I'm having a difficult day with my memory, speaking is just more natural than trying to figure out complex interfaces.                                                      | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION     |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I also really appreciate the shared notes feature with John. Having that "Where things are" note that tells me my keys are on the hook by the front door - that's exactly the kind of help I need!                                                                                                  | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | And I love that John and I can both see the same information. It makes me feel more connected to him even when he's at work.                                                                                                                                                                        | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The time picker was really frustrating for me. I tried several times to change my medication reminder from 12:00 to 8:00 AM, but I couldn't get it to work properly.                                                                                                                                | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The sliders were confusing and didn't seem to respond the way I expected. For someone like me who sometimes has trouble with fine motor control or remembering exactly how interfaces work, that was quite discouraging.                                                                            | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                     |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Also, I was confused about how to mark tasks as completed. When I tapped on my doctor's appointment, I expected to be able to just check it off, but instead it opened the editing screen.                                                                                                          | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | It took me a while to figure out that I needed to delete the completed task instead. That wasn't very intuitive for me.                                                                                                                                                                             | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The initial slides were helpful for the big picture... gave me a good overview of what the app could do.                                                                                                                                                                                            | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | But honestly, at that stage, it was a bit abstract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The step-by-step guidance was much more practical... When it showed me "Tap here to add a task" with the little numbered circles, I could immediately see what I needed to do.                                                                                                                      | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | As someone with memory challenges, the contextual, step-by-step guidance was definitely more valuable.                                                                                                                                                                                              | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Learning by doing - right there in the real interface - sticks better than trying to remember abstract concepts from slides I saw earlier.                                                                                                                                                          | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The activity logs that show when I create or complete tasks? That would give John some peace of mind when he's at work.                                                                                                                                                                             | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | What I really appreciate is that this doesn't make me feel like I'm being "managed" or watched over. It feels collaborative - like John and I are working together to help me stay independent.                                                                                                     | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Sometimes I worry about being a burden on John with all my memory issues. But this app could actually make things easier for both of us.                                                                                                                                                            | PF_BURDEN_REDUCTION                   | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Photo reminders: Sometimes I forget what my pills look like, or I can't remember if I already took them. It would be wonderful if I could take a photo of my medication bottle and attach it to my reminder.                                                                                        | FS_MULTIMEDIA_NOTES                   | FS_MEDICATION_VISUAL_AID               |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Simple daily check-ins: Some days I feel really good and clear-minded, other days are more foggy. It would be helpful to have a simple way to log how I'm feeling each day.                                                                                                                         | FS_MOOD_TRACKING                      | FS_ROUTINE_DEVIATION_DETECTION         |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Emergency contacts that are really obvious: Maybe a big, bright "CALL JOHN" button right on the main screen that I could tap even when I'm confused or scared.                                                                                                                                      | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                 | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Medication tracking that's more visual: Instead of just a reminder, what if there was a simple way to mark "taken" with a big checkmark.                                                                                                                                                            | FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING                | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Location reminders: Since the app has location features, it would be amazing if it could remind me of things when I'm in certain places.                                                                                                                                                            | FS_LOCATION_BASED_REMINDERS           | FS_SMART_FEATURES_NEEDED               |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Simpler time setting: That time picker was really frustrating! Maybe just having preset times like "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening" or being able to type in the time would be easier.                                                                                                             | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The location sharing features... I'm honestly torn about this... there's also something that feels a bit... watched?                                                                                                                                                                                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I'm only 51, and I still drive and go places on my own. I don't want to feel like I'm being monitored all the time.                                                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | The key is that these features should help us stay connected and support each other, not make me feel like I'm being supervised.                                                                                                                                                                    | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | Where the app's calling feature could be really valuable is if I'm confused or panicked... having that big obvious way to reach John right in the app I'm already using could be a lifesaver.                                                                                                       | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                 |                                        |                                      |
| Jane          | Carereceiver | I want them available when I need them, but I don't want to feel like I have to use them for everything. I still want to maintain my normal routines and independence as much as possible.                                                                                                          | FS_SELECTIVE_FEATURE_USE              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | The voice command feature! When I first saw it, I was nervous about talking to my phone, but it turned out to be so much easier than I expected.                                                                                                                                                    | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I just said "Remind me about my doctor appointment next Tuesday at 10 in the morning" and it understood me perfectly! It was like talking to a helpful person instead of struggling with all those buttons and sliders.                                                                             | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And I also really love the shared notes feature with Ally. Finding her note about where my keys are - "on the hook by the front door" - that was such a relief!                                                                                                                                     | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | It's wonderful that she can leave me helpful reminders like that. It makes me feel less alone in managing my memory problems.                                                                                                                                                                       | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_EMOTIONAL_SUPPORT                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | That time picker was quite confusing! All those sliding things with numbers like "5006" and "4980" - I had no idea what those meant or how to change the time to 8 AM like I wanted.                                                                                                                | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I ended up with 4 PM instead, which isn't ideal for my morning medicine, but I gave up trying to figure it out.                                                                                                                                                                                     | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_TASK_ABANDONMENT                   |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And I still don't understand how to actually check off my tasks as completed. Every time I try to tap on the checkbox, it takes me to the edit screen instead.                                                                                                                                      | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | That's frustrating because I want to mark when I've taken my medicine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING                 |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I don't like this... This sounds like they want to track where I go. I'm not a child! I can still go to the market by myself sometimes, even with my arthritis.                                                                                                                                     | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Ally already worries enough about me. I don't need her getting alerts every time I step outside. That's... that's too much. I still have some independence, you know.                                                                                                                               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | But I suppose... sometimes I do get confused about where I am. Last week I couldn't remember which bus to take home from the market. Maybe it's not such a bad idea?                                                                                                                                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_SAFETY_CONSIDERATION               |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | The step-by-step guidance on the actual task page - that was much more helpful! When it showed me the empty screen and said "Tasks will show up here," then "Tap here to add a task," that was so much clearer.                                                                                     | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | So yes, definitely the step-by-step guidance was more useful. It's the difference between someone saying "this app helps with reminders" versus someone saying "tap this button here to create your reminder."                                                                                      | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | At my age, with my memory issues, I need the specific, practical guidance much more than the general overview.                                                                                                                                                                                      | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                     |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | The initial slides at the beginning... were quite vague, weren't they? I remember reading about reminders and connecting with "mates," but I didn't really understand what that meant practically.                                                                                                  | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And that location tracking slide about "safe zones" actually made me a bit uncomfortable - it sounded like being watched.                                                                                                                                                                           | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I could see when I created my tasks and when Ally created that note for me. It's like a little diary of what we've both been doing to help me manage things. That made me feel... well, less alone in dealing with my memory problems.                                                              | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL               | PF_EMOTIONAL_SUPPORT                   | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING             |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | What I really appreciate is that the Connect screen feels like... well, like a shared space where Ally and I can help each other.                                                                                                                                                                   | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | It doesn't feel like she's watching me or managing me - it feels more like we're working together as a team. That's important to me. I still want to feel independent, but it's nice to know she's there supporting me.                                                                             | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | First, I'd love if there was a way to make the time picker much simpler! Maybe just big buttons for morning, afternoon, and evening, or a simple clock face where I could tap the time I want.                                                                                                      | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And I really need to figure out how to check off completed tasks. Maybe there could be a big, obvious "Done" button that's separate from the edit function?                                                                                                                                         | AFI_TASK_COMPLETION_DIFFICULTY        | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | What about a feature that could take a photo of where I put important things? Like, I could take a picture of my keys on the hook by the door, and then when I can't find them, the app could show me the photo to remind me where they go.                                                         | FS_MULTIMEDIA_NOTES                   | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And for my medical needs - maybe a way to track if I've actually taken my medicine each day? Sometimes I stand at the medicine cabinet and can't remember if I already took my pills that morning.                                                                                                  | FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING                | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | Since this works with family members, maybe there could be a gentle way for Ally to know if I haven't checked off my medicine reminder by evening? Not like an alarm, but just so she knows to maybe give me a call to check in.                                                                    | FS_GENTLE_MONITORING                  | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | And maybe... this might sound silly, but what about reminders for happy things too? Like "Call your sister today" or "Your favorite TV show is on tonight."                                                                                                                                         | PF_POSITIVE_REMINDERS                 | AFI_SOCIAL_CONNECTION                  |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I'm not sure I'm ready to explain it to my sister or teach her how to use it... I'm still figuring this app out myself!                                                                                                                                                                             | AFI_TECHNOLOGY_LEARNING_CURVE         |                                        |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | With Ally, it's different - she set this up for me, and she understands my memory problems. She knows how to help without making me feel... well, like I'm being managed or watched too closely.                                                                                                    | PF_TRUSTED_CAREGIVER_RELATIONSHIP     | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I'd want to make sure they understand it's to help me, not to keep track of me or make me feel like I can't handle things myself.                                                                                                                                                                   | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | FS_SELECTIVE_SHARING                   |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | If I really needed to reach Ally urgently - like if I was confused about my medicine or couldn't find something important - I wouldn't want to rely on a feature that might not work.                                                                                                               | AFI_RELIABILITY_CONCERNS              | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                  |                                      |
| Ally's Mother | Carereceiver | I could be looking at our shared notes about where my keys are, and then call her directly from the same screen if I still can't find them. That would be very convenient.                                                                                                                          | FS_INTEGRATED_COMMUNICATION           | AFI_CONTEXTUAL_CALLING                 |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The voice command feature is absolutely my favorite part! Being able to just say "Remind me to walk my dog at 6 PM every day" and have it create the task perfectly is incredible.                                                                                                                  | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | On days when my fine motor skills aren't as sharp or when I'm feeling overwhelmed, being able to just speak naturally instead of navigating through multiple screens is a huge relief.                                                                                                              | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 | PF_ACCESSIBILITY                       | PF_COGNITIVE_LOAD_REDUCTION          |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The fact that it understood my natural language and converted it correctly to the app's format shows really thoughtful design.                                                                                                                                                                      | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I also love the shared notes feature I just discovered. Having that quick reference for "where things are" is invaluable for someone like me.                                                                                                                                                       | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Sometimes I forget where I put my keys or glasses, and having that information easily accessible gives me confidence and reduces anxiety.                                                                                                                                                           | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_ANXIETY_REDUCTION                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The time picker is definitely my biggest frustration. When I was trying to set my medication reminder to 8 AM, I struggled with those sliders and ended up with 4 AM, then 5 AM - never quite getting to where I wanted.                                                                            | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | For someone who might have some dexterity challenges or cognitive load issues, those tiny sliders are really difficult to use precisely.                                                                                                                                                            | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       | AFI_ACCESSIBILITY_AND_COGNITIVE_LOAD |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I wish there was a simpler way to set times, maybe with larger buttons or a different interface altogether.                                                                                                                                                                                         | AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY            | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I also found some of the navigation a bit confusing initially... there were moments where I wasn't sure if I was in settings, or connect mode, or the main app.                                                                                                                                     | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | A clearer visual hierarchy or maybe some breadcrumbs would help me feel more oriented, especially on days when my cognitive load is higher.                                                                                                                                                         | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | PF_COGNITIVE_LOAD_REDUCTION            |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The tutorial that showed me exactly where things would appear - "Tasks will show up here," "Tap here to add a task," "You can also edit tasks with your voice" - was infinitely more useful.                                                                                                        | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | For someone like me who might have some cognitive challenges, seeing the real buttons and areas while being guided through them made it stick much better.                                                                                                                                          | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_COGNITIVE_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | What made the step-by-step tutorial especially good was that it was progressive - it didn't overwhelm me with everything at once.                                                                                                                                                                   | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        | PF_COGNITIVE_LOAD_REDUCTION          |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Keep both, but maybe make the initial slides shorter and more focused on the key value proposition, then rely more heavily on the contextual, step-by-step guidance.                                                                                                                                | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | For people with memory issues, learning by doing in the real interface is much more effective than abstract explanations.                                                                                                                                                                           | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The shared notes feature we just looked at - with the reminder about where my keys are - shows how helpful it could be to have family members who can add important information I might forget.                                                                                                     | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | But I also have some concerns: Independence is really important to me. At 50, with younger-onset Alzheimer's, I'm still very capable and want to maintain my autonomy as much as possible.                                                                                                          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I worry about feeling like I'm being monitored or watched constantly. There's a difference between having support available and feeling surveilled.                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The location sharing feature, for example, makes me a bit uncomfortable... right now, I'm still getting around just fine on my own, and I don't want to feel like I'm being tracked.                                                                                                                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I think I'd want to start slowly and selectively. Maybe begin by sharing just the task reminders with one trusted family member... That feels supportive rather than intrusive.                                                                                                                     | FS_SELECTIVE_SHARING                  |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | But I'd want to maintain control over what gets shared and with whom.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | FS_SELECTIVE_SHARING                   |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I want technology that helps me stay independent longer, not technology that makes me feel like I'm already losing my independence.                                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Photo-based reminders: Sometimes I struggle to remember what something looks like or where exactly it is. It would be amazing if I could attach photos to tasks or notes.                                                                                                                           | FS_MULTIMEDIA_NOTES                   | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Emergency contact quick access: I'd love a prominent emergency button that could quickly call my doctor, family member, or emergency services if I'm feeling confused or disoriented.                                                                                                               | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                 |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Medication tracking with dosage reminders: Sometimes I can't remember if I already took my pills or not. A simple "mark as taken" feature with a visual confirmation would prevent double-dosing.                                                                                                   | FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING                | AFI_SAFETY_FEATURES                    |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Daily routine templates: It would be wonderful to have preset routines I could activate... On particularly difficult days, having a structured template would be very grounding.                                                                                                                    | FS_ROUTINE_TEMPLATES                  | PF_COGNITIVE_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Voice notes feature: Sometimes I want to quickly record a thought or reminder when I'm not near the app or can't type.                                                                                                                                                                              | FS_VOICE_MESSAGE_AND_NOTES            | AFI_QUICK_CAPTURE                      |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | Simple calendar integration: I'd love to see my appointments and reminders in one place, maybe a simple week view.                                                                                                                                                                                  | FS_CALENDAR_INTEGRATION               | AFI_UNIFIED_VIEW                       |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The core of what I'd want is anything that reduces cognitive load while maintaining my dignity and independence.                                                                                                                                                                                    | PF_COGNITIVE_LOAD_REDUCTION           | AFI_DIGNITY_PRESERVATION               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL         |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The "Mate's Location" feature gives me pause... it feels quite invasive at my current stage... it feels like it assumes I'm less capable than I am.                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | These features feel like they're designed for someone at a more advanced stage of memory impairment than where I am now.                                                                                                                                                                            | FS_STAGE_APPROPRIATE_FEATURES         |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | I'd prefer to ease into the sharing features gradually - maybe starting with just task sharing and notes, then adding location features only if and when I feel I need that level of support.                                                                                                       | AFI_PROGRESSIVE_FEATURES              |                                        |                                      |
| Jacky         | Carereceiver | The key for me is maintaining agency over what gets shared and when.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The thing that absolutely blew me away was when I saw that notification: "Chang marked 'Take medication' as done. a minute ago"                                                                                                                                                                     | PF_NOTIFICATION_SUCCESS               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | As a daughter living an hour away, working from home, constantly worrying about Dad who won't admit he has memory issues - that one little notification gave me such incredible peace of mind!                                                                                                      | PF_NOTIFICATION_SUCCESS               | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | AFI_REMOTE_CAREGIVING                |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | It's like having a gentle, respectful way to stay connected to Dad's daily life without being intrusive or making him feel like we don't trust him.                                                                                                                                                 | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The app preserves his dignity while giving us the information we need.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | AFI_DIGNITY_PRESERVATION              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Oh my goodness, trying to add Dad's phone number and set up the calling feature was SO frustrating!                                                                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          |                                        |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The phone number kept disappearing every time I navigated away. I couldn't tell if my changes were actually saving. Had to re-enter information multiple times.                                                                                                                                     | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            | AFI_DATA_PERSISTENCE_ISSUES          |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | For someone like me - a 64-year-old daughter trying to help her elderly father - that kind of confusion is really stressful. When you're worried about a parent and trying to set up something important for their safety, you don't want to be fighting with the interface.                        | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                     |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I kept wondering "Did it save? Do I need to do this again?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID           | AFI_UNCERTAINTY_ISSUES                 |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The Shared Notes and Shared Logs are brilliant! Seeing Mrs. Chang's loving message to Dad, and then all the activity logs showing his medication compliance - it creates this beautiful complete picture of family care.                                                                            | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING             |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The logs especially gave me such peace of mind - seeing timestamps of when Dad took his medication, when we connected, when notes were created. It's like a gentle family diary of care.                                                                                                            | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING             |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The step-by-step guidance when I was actually doing things - that was so much better! Like when I was in the safe zone editor and it said "Tap on the map to set the center of your safe zone" - that was exactly what I needed to know, exactly when I neede                                       |                                       |                                        |                                      |

| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The initial tutorial slides were nice and gave me a good big picture overview... But honestly, they felt a bit... generic?

| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Here's what I think would have been most helpful: if the initial tutorial had shown me real scenarios that matched my situation.                                                                                                                                                                    | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Instead of calling multiple times a day (which sometimes annoys him), I could have that gentle background reassurance that he's okay.                                                                                                                                                               | AFI_REMOTE_CAREGIVING                 | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL         |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The biggest challenge would be getting Dad to actually use it. He's pretty stubborn about technology and doesn't like admitting he needs help.                                                                                                                                                      | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                      |                                        |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | But you know what? If we positioned it as "this helps the family stay connected" rather than "this is to help with your memory," he might be more open to it.                                                                                                                                       | AFI_FRAMING_STRATEGY                  | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The peace of mind it would give me as a working daughter caring for an aging parent from a distance - that's priceless.                                                                                                                                                                             | AFI_REMOTE_CAREGIVING                 | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | It would help me be a better daughter while letting Dad maintain his dignity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_DIGNITY_PRESERVATION               |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Like if Dad usually makes his morning tea by 7 AM but one day he doesn't, I could get a gentle alert. Not intrusive, but just "Hey, Dad's routine seems different today - might be worth a check-in call."                                                                                          | FS_ROUTINE_DEVIATION_DETECTION        | FS_GENTLE_MONITORING                   |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | What if there was a feature where: I could schedule appointments and add them to his reminders. The app could send gentle, encouraging messages about upcoming appointments.                                                                                                                        | FS_APPOINTMENT                        | FS_MEDICAL_COORDINATION                |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | What if there could be simple check-ins like: "Did you eat lunch today?" with a simple yes/no button. Hydration reminders (Dad forgets to drink water).                                                                                                                                             | FS_MEAL_TRACKING_NEEDED               | FS_HYDRATION_REMINDERS                 |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | There was a panic button he could press that immediately alerts all family members. Voice message capabilities - he's much better with speaking than typing.                                                                                                                                        | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                 | AFI_VOICE_INTERACTION                  |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Dad would need the app to be SUPER simple. Like: Extra large buttons and text. Voice commands instead of typing. Picture-based navigation.                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Photo confirmations - he could snap a pic of the pills he took. Medication inventory tracking - alerts when he's running low.                                                                                                                                                                       | FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING                | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | A special view for caregivers that shows: Weekly/monthly patterns in one glance. What everyone in the family is doing for Dad's care.                                                                                                                                                               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                  | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | But when I saw "Chang is outside the safe zone" - that gave me pause. Yes, I want Dad to be safe, but I also don't want him to feel like he's being watched or tracked everywhere he goes.                                                                                                          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | Dad values his independence SO much. If he knew every time he walked to the corner store or visited a neighbor, his daughter was getting notifications... would that make him feel trusted or surveilled?                                                                                           | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           | AFI_TRUST_ISSUES                     |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | I wish there were granular privacy settings where I could choose: Alert me only if he leaves the safe zone for more than 2 hours. Send notifications only during certain times of day.                                                                                                              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | FS_CUSTOMIZABLE_ALERTS                 |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The Connect screen brilliantly solves the central challenge of family caregiving: How do you stay involved and helpful without being intrusive?                                                                                                                                                     | PF_FAMILY_CAREGIVING_BALANCE          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ms. Chang     | Caregiver    | The communication and coordination features are perfect. The location features are powerful and probably necessary, but they require careful, respectful use.                                                                                                                                       | PF_FEATURE_BALANCE                    | AFI_RESPECTFUL_USE                     |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The notification system and task monitoring is absolutely wonderful! Being able to see in real-time when Mr. Chang takes his medication gives me such peace of mind.                                                                                                                                | PF_NOTIFICATION_SUCCESS               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | PF_REAL_TIME_MONITORING              |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | When I saw that notification "Chang marked 'Take medication' as done" - that was exactly what I needed as his caregiver.                                                                                                                                                                            | PF_NOTIFICATION_SUCCESS               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It lets me know he's taking care of himself without me having to constantly ask him about it, which preserves his dignity.                                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_DIGNITY_PRESERVATION              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I also really love the Shared Space feature, especially the shared logs and notes. Being able to leave him that caring message about lunch being ready and his daughter's visit - that feels so personal and loving.                                                                                | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It's like leaving little notes on the refrigerator, but he can access them anytime on his phone.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_FAMILIAR_METAPHOR                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The safe zone feature is also excellent for someone with memory issues like Mr. Chang. The 670-meter radius gives him freedom to walk around our neighborhood, but I'll get alerted if he wanders too far.                                                                                          | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      | PF_BALANCED_MONITORING               |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | That's exactly the right balance of safety and independence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | PF_BALANCED_MONITORING                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           | AFI_SAFETY_FEATURES                  |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The phone number validation system was really frustrating! I tried multiple times to enter Mr. Chang's phone number in different formats, and it kept giving me "Please enter a valid phone number" errors.                                                                                         | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          |                                        |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | As a caregiver, I need to be able to call him quickly if there's an emergency, but the system made it unnecessarily difficult to save his contact information properly.                                                                                                                             | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                  | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                 |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | That's a critical feature that should work smoothly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | AFI_RELIABILITY_CONCERNS              | AFI_CRITICAL_FEATURES                  |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Also, the contact setup process felt a bit convoluted. Having to request contacts access and then getting taken out of the app flow - that was confusing for someone like me who isn't very tech-savvy.                                                                                             | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                     |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The step-by-step tutorial on the actual task page was far more valuable for me as a caregiver!                                                                                                                                                                                                      | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | That hands-on guidance was exactly what I needed. As someone who's not very tech-savvy, seeing where to actually tap and what each screen does was so much more helpful than just reading about features.                                                                                           | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wish there had been a tutorial specifically for caregivers that showed me how to: Connect with my mate, Set up safe zones, Access the notification center, Use the Shared Space for leaving notes.                                                                                                | FS_CAREGIVER_TUTORIALS_NEEDED         |                                        |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Those are the features I actually use most as Mrs. Chang, but I had to figure them out on my own.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | AFI_CAREGIVER_SPECIFIC_FEATURES       | AFI_SELF_DISCOVERY_CHALLENGES          |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The tutorials focused more on personal task management, when what I really needed was guidance on the caregiving and family coordination features.                                                                                                                                                  | FS_CAREGIVER_TUTORIALS_NEEDED         | AFI_FEATURE_FOCUS_MISMATCH             |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I'd love to see role-specific tutorials - one for the person being cared for (like Mr. Chang) and one for the caregiver (like me) that focuses on the monitoring and communication features we actually use.                                                                                        | AFI_ROLE_SPECIFIC_TUTORIALS           | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | This app has been perfect for our situation. He has memory issues but still wants his independence, and I need to balance giving him space while making sure he's safe.                                                                                                                             | PF_BALANCED_CAREGIVING                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I can support him without being intrusive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          |                                        |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wish there was a family version that could connect multiple caregivers! For example, Ms. Chang (his daughter) and I both care for Mr. Chang.                                                                                                                                                      | FS_MULTIPLE_CAREGIVERS                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It would be wonderful if we could both get the notifications about his medication and both be able to leave him notes.                                                                                                                                                                              | FS_MULTIPLE_CAREGIVERS                |                                        |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Also, having his doctor or healthcare team be able to see his medication compliance data would be incredibly valuable for his care.                                                                                                                                                                 | FS_HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION             | FS_MEDICAL_COORDINATION                |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | If yes - this app is wonderful. If it's just family wanting to "stay connected" - regular phone calls and family group chats work better and feel less invasive.                                                                                                                                    | PF_APPROPRIATE_USE_CASES              | AFI_GENUINE_CAREGIVING_NEED            |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It's really about using technology to enhance care and safety, not to control or spy on people.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FS_ENHANCEMENT_NOT_CONTROL            | AFI_RESPECTFUL_TECHNOLOGY              |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I'd love an emergency button that Mr. Chang could press if he falls or feels unwell. Sometimes when people have memory issues, they might not remember how to call for help, but a big red button in the app would be simple.                                                                       | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                 | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The biggest thing I wish for is connecting multiple family members... We're both caring for him!                                                                                                                                                                                                    | FS_MULTIPLE_CAREGIVERS                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wish his doctor could see his medication compliance data. When we go to appointments, I try to remember if he's been taking his pills regularly, but having that data available would be so much better for his care.                                                                             | FS_HEALTHCARE_INTEGRATION             | FS_MEDICAL_DATA_SHARING                |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Since Mr. Chang has hearing issues and isn't great with typing, voice messages in the Shared Space would be wonderful.                                                                                                                                                                              | FS_VOICE_MESSAGE_AND_NOTES            | FS_ACCESSIBILITY                       | AFI_HEARING_ACCOMMODATIONS           |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I'd love to see daily routine patterns - like when he typically wakes up, eats meals, or goes for walks. If he suddenly changes his routine... that could indicate he's not feeling well.                                                                                                           | FS_ROUTINE_TRACKING                   | FS_PATTERN_RECOGNITION                 | FS_HEALTH_MONITORING                 |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | Maybe a shared calendar where I could add things like "Doctor appointment Tuesday 2pm" or "Ms. Chang visiting Saturday."                                                                                                                                                                            | FS_SHARED_CALENDAR                    | FS_APPOINTMENT                         |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | If the app could somehow detect if he's fallen and hasn't moved for a while, that would give me incredible peace of mind.                                                                                                                                                                           | FS_FALL_DETECTION                     | AFI_SAFETY_FEATURES                    |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | For the person being cared for, maybe an even simpler view - just the most important tasks and notes in very large text, without all the technical features that might confuse someone with memory issues.                                                                                          | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION      | PF_ACCESSIBILITY                       | PF_COGNITIVE_SUPPORT                 |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The Mate's Location with Safe Zone is absolutely my favorite! Being able to see where Mr. Chang is and getting alerts when he leaves the safe zone gives me such peace of mind.                                                                                                                     | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | For someone with memory issues, this is essential safety without being too restrictive.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                      | PF_BALANCED_MONITORING               |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | I wish there was a quick message feature right on the Connect screen - like a "Send quick check-in" button that could send him a pre-written message.                                                                                                                                               | FS_QUICK_MESSAGING                    | AFI_STREAMLINED_COMMUNICATION          |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | The Connect screen really feels like the heart of the caregiving features.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_CONNECT_SCREEN_CENTRAL            | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Mrs. Chang    | Caregiver    | It really does make me feel more "connected" to his wellbeing, which is exactly what the screen name promises!                                                                                                                                                                                      | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | FS_WELLBEING_MONITORING                |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The feature I appreciate most is getting that immediate notification when Jane marked her medication as "done." Seeing "Jane marked 'Take medication' as done. a few seconds ago" in my notifications was such a relief!                                                                            | PF_NOTIFICATION_SUCCESS               | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | PF_REAL_TIME_MONITORING              |
| John          | Caregiver    | As someone who's at work teaching all day, my biggest worry is whether Jane remembers to take her medication with her memory issues.

| John          | Caregiver    | The integration between the task system, notifications, and shared logs works beautifully - I can see what happened, when it happened, and get alerted right away.                                                                                                                                  | PF_SYSTEM_INTEGRATION                 | PF_COMPREHENSIVE_TRACKING              |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The most frustrating part was trying to actually make a call to Jane through the app. I successfully added her contact information and set up the calling method, but when I tried to initiate a call, it kept taking me back to the edit screen instead of actually dialing.                       | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |

It would save time to have templates like "Monday School Day"                                                                                                                                                                         | FS_ROUTINE_TEMPLATES                  | AFI_WORKFLOW_EFFICIENCY                |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | Doctor Appointment Sharing: When we have medical appointments, it would be great if the app could automatically share the details with Tom                                                                                                                                                          | FS_APPOINTMENT_SHARING                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | Daily Check-in Prompts: A gentle reminder for Jane to just tap "I'm okay" once a day so I know she's responsive.                                                                                                                                                                                    | FS_DAILY_CHECKIN_NEEDED               | FS_WELLNESS_MONITORING                 |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | Smart Home Integration: Connecting with smart door locks or lights so I can see if she's moving around the house normally.                                                                                                                                                                          | FS_SMART_HOME_INTEGRATION             | FS_PASSIVE_MONITORING                  |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | Medication Photo Verification: Jane could take a photo of her pills before taking them, so I can verify she's taking the right medication.                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_MEDICATION_VERIFICATION           | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            | AFI_SAFETY_FEATURES                  |
| John          | Caregiver    | The Three-Tab Layout is Perfect: Having Mates' Contacts, Mate's Location, and Shared Space all in one place makes sense.                                                                                                                                                                            | PF_CONNECT_LAYOUT_GOOD                | PF_ORGANIZATION_EFFECTIVE              |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | Mate's Location with Real-Time Updates: This is incredibly valuable. Seeing "Last updated: 2025-08-05 03:50:40" tells me the information is current.                                                                                                                                                | AFI_REAL_TIME_MONITORING              | AFI_TIMESTAMP_VALUABLE                 |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The Safezone Feature is Brilliant: Getting that "Jane is outside the safe zone" alert is exactly what I needed.                                                                                                                                                                                     | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    |                                        |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The ability to set it up around our home with a 50-meter radius strikes the right balance between safety and freedom.                                                                                                                                                                               | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_APPROPRIATE_RADIUS                  |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | This might be my favorite part. Being able to leave loving notes like "Today's Plan - Monday" and see Jane's practical notes creates a real sense of connection throughout the day.                                                                                                                 | AFI_SHARED_SPACE_CONNECTION           | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | FS_DAILY_COORDINATION                |
| John          | Caregiver    | The shared logs showing our activity timeline helps us both stay aware of what's happening.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL               | AFI_MUTUAL_AWARENESS                   |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The Connect screen addresses the three things I worry about most as a caregiver: Where is she? How can I reach her? How can we coordinate?                                                                                                                                                          | AFI_CORE_CAREGIVER_NEEDS              | AFI_COMPREHENSIVE_SOLUTION             |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The concepts are exactly right - it just needs some UI improvements to make the execution smoother.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | AFI_CONCEPT_VALIDATION                | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| John          | Caregiver    | The Connect screen feels like it was designed by people who understand caregiving relationships, which gives me confidence in this app.                                                                                                                                                             | AFI_CAREGIVER_UNDERSTANDING           | AFI_DESIGN_EMPATHY                     |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The Shared Space is absolutely incredible - it's become the heart of our caregiving relationship. Being able to see that Mom completed her blood pressure medication this morning, and then being able to leave her that loving note... it makes me feel so connected to her even when I'm at work. | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | PF_WORK_LIFE_BALANCE                 |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The location tracking and safe zone feature is also a huge relief. With Mom's memory issues and that scary incident last month when she got lost going to the market, knowing I'll get an alert if she wanders too far gives me such peace of mind.                                                 | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The 480-meter radius around our home feels just right - she can still walk to familiar places but I'll know if she's in trouble.                                                                                                                                                                    | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | PF_APPROPRIATE_RADIUS                  | PF_INDEPENDENCE_SAFETY_BALANCE       |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | And seeing the activity logs - like when she marks tasks complete or creates new reminders - it helps me understand her daily routine and gives me confidence that she's managing well on her own.                                                                                                  | PF_ACTIVITY_LOGS_USEFUL               | AFI_ROUTINE_UNDERSTANDING              |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The onboarding process was quite long and sometimes confusing. There were multiple tutorial screens for different sections, and I wasn't always sure if I was in the right place or if my settings were being saved.                                                                                | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT               | AFI_SETTING_UNCERTAINTY                |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | When I was trying to adjust the safe zone radius, it wasn't immediately clear how to change it from that tiny 50 meters to something more appropriate.                                                                                                                                              | AFI_SAFEZONE_SETUP_DIFFICULTY         | AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION       |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Also, the interface for adding Mom's phone number could have been more intuitive. I thought tapping on her contact would call her directly, but instead it took me to an editing screen.                                                                                                            | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          |                                        |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | For someone in a caregiving situation who might be stressed or need to contact their loved one quickly, that extra step could be frustrating.                                                                                                                                                       | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                  | FS_QUICK_ACCESS_NEEDED                 |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | This app is giving me something I've desperately needed - a way to care for Mom while still respecting her independence. That's worth everything to me.                                                                                                                                             | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | PF_BALANCED_CAREGIVING                 |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The initial slides were helpful for the big picture... really sold me on the concept. As someone who's constantly overwhelmed with Mom's care, seeing that this app was specifically designed for people like us - caregivers and care recipients working together - that gave me hope right away.  | AFI_INITIAL_SLIDES_INSPIRING          | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   | AFI_TARGET_AUDIENCE_RECOGNITION      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | But the step-by-step guidance was more practically useful... that was much more actionable. It guided me through exactly what I could do in each section.                                                                                                                                           | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The initial slides got me excited, but then there was this gap where I had to figure out how to actually start using the features. I remember feeling a bit lost trying to find where to sign up or connect with Mom.                                                                               | AFI_GUIDANCE_GAP                      | FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT                |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Maybe what would have been even better is if, after those inspiring initial slides, there was a clear "Getting Started" checklist                                                                                                                                                                   | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   |                                        |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The step-by-step guidance within each feature was definitely more useful for actually learning to use the app, but those initial slides were important for understanding the vision and getting me emotionally invested in the process.                                                             | PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL                   | AFI_EMOTIONAL_INVESTMENT_IMPORTANT     |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | If we could all be connected through this app, imagine how much better we could support Mom together! Her sister could see when Mom completes her daily tasks and feel reassured.                                                                                                                   | PF_FAMILY_NETWORK_BENEFITS            | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | My uncle could add notes about their weekend walks. My cousins could check in on her location if they're worried. And Mom wouldn't feel like she's being "managed" by just me                                                                                                                       | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The only thing I'd worry about is making sure it doesn't become too much - like if everyone's constantly checking on Mom or leaving notes, it might make her feel watched or overwhelmed.                                                                                                           | AFI_OVERWHELMING_CONCERN              | PF_BALANCED_INVOLVEMENT                |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | But the shared logs would be amazing for family coordination. Instead of me having to update everyone individually about Mom's doctor appointments or medication changes, they could all see the updates in real-time.                                                                              | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_REAL_TIME_MONITORING               |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Yes, I think this could really help our whole family care for Mom together while still respecting her independence. It would take so much pressure off me as the primary caregiver.                                                                                                                 | AFI_PRESSURE_RELIEF                   | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL         |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Medication reminders with photos: Mom sometimes gets confused about which pills are which... If I could add photos of her actual medication bottles to the reminders, that would be so helpful.                                                                                                     | FS_MEDICATION_VISUAL_AID              | AFI_VISUAL_FEEDBACK_AND_AID            |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Simple voice messages: Sometimes I just want to send Mom a quick "thinking of you" voice message that she can play easily. With her memory issues, hearing my voice... might be more meaningful than text.                                                                                          | FS_VOICE_MESSAGE_AND_NOTES            | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING               | PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT                    |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Emergency contacts integration: What if the app could automatically call me if Mom hasn't checked off a critical task like her morning medication by a certain time? Or if she's been in the same location for too long and might need help?                                                        | FS_AUTOMATED_ALERTS                   | FS_EMERGENCY_FEATURES                  |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Weekly summary for family: A simple weekly email summary I could share with Mom's sister and other relatives... without overwhelming them with daily notifications.                                                                                                                                 | FS_FAMILY_SUMMARY                     | PF_COMMUNICATION_BALANCE               |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Simple grocery/errand sharing: Mom sometimes forgets what she needs at the store. If we could share a simple shopping list or if she could easily tell me "I'm out of milk" through the app                                                                                                         | FS_DAILY_COORDINATION                 |                                        |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The biggest thing is keeping it simple enough for Mom to use when she's having a bad memory day, but comprehensive enough to give me the peace of mind I need as a caregiver.                                                                                                                       | PF_SIMPLICITY_COMPLEXITY_BALANCE      | PF_ACCESSIBILITY                       | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                 |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The three-tab layout is perfect - "Mates' Contacts," "Mate's Location," and "Shared Space" covers everything I need as a caregiver. It's like having a complete dashboard for Mom's wellbeing.                                                                                                      | PF_CONNECT_LAYOUT_GOOD                | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The Mate's Location with the safe zone setup was a game-changer. Being able to see where Mom is and set up that 480-meter radius around our home... that addresses my biggest fear about her getting lost.                                                                                          | PF_LOCATION_SAFETY                    | AFI_BIGGEST_FEAR_ADDRESSED             |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The Shared Space is incredible - seeing the activity logs, being able to leave loving notes for Mom, and tracking everything from her medication completion to our connection history.                                                                                                              | PF_SHARED_NOTES_USEFUL                | PF_COMPREHENSIVE_TRACKING              | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING             |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | It makes me feel so connected to her daily life even when I can't be there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING              | AFI_DAILY_LIFE_AWARENESS               |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The Mates' Contacts section felt a bit clunky. When I tapped on Mom's contact, I expected it to call her directly, but instead it took me to an editing screen. In a caregiving emergency, I need that call button to be immediate and obvious.                                                     | AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY          | AFI_EMERGENCY_COMMUNICATION            |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | Also, it would be amazing if the location screen showed not just where Mom is now, but maybe her recent movement patterns - like "walked to the market this morning, returned home safely."                                                                                                         | FS_MOVEMENT_PATTERNS                  | FS_ROUTINE_TRACKING                    |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | The Connect screen really captures the essence of what caregiving should be - staying connected while respecting independence.                                                                                                                                                                      | AFI_CAREGIVING_ESSENCE                | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL           |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | It gives me all the information I need to support Mom without making her feel like she's being constantly monitored. That balance is so hard to achieve, and this app really gets it right.                                                                                                         | AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL          | PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT                   |                                      |
| Ally          | Caregiver    | It's transformed how I think about caring for Mom from a distance. Instead of constant worry, I have confidence and connection.                                                                                                                                                                     | PF_WORRY_TO_CONFIDENCE                | AFI_DISTANCE_CAREGIVING_TRANSFORMATION |                                      |
