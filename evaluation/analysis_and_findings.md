# Evaluation – Analysis and Findings

This directory contains the analysis of GPT-simulated persona evaluations conducted for the Ting Mate project after the functional prototype was developed.

The analysis used **directed content analysis** to categorize post-task feedback and think-aloud comments into three predefined themes: **Positive Feedback**, **Areas for Improvement**, and **Feature Suggestions**. Codes were applied only to the feedback portions of the interaction transcripts (including think-aloud commentary), and each occurrence was counted separately for memory-impaired personas (care receivers) and caregiver personas.

## Top Three Most Frequent Codes by Persona Group

The table below summarizes the three most frequent codes for each persona group, with occurrence counts in parentheses.

| Care receiver personas                                              | Caregiver personas                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Collaboration feeling (`PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING`, 12)              | Caregiver support (`PF_CAREGIVER_SUPPORT`, 23)                     |
| Tutorial helpful (`PF_TUTORIAL_HELPFUL`, 12)                        | Collaboration feeling (`PF_COLLABORATION_FEELING`, 21)             |
| Memory support (`PF_MEMORY_SUPPORT`, 11)                            | Location safety (`PF_LOCATION_SAFETY`, 9)                          |
| Privacy & autonomy control (`AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL`, 35)     | Privacy & autonomy control (`AFI_PRIVACY_AUTONOMY_CONTROL`, 20)    |
| UI complexity & navigation (`AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION`, 14) | UI complexity & navigation (`AFI_UI_COMPLEXITY_AND_NAVIGATION`, 9) |
| Time picker difficulty (`AFI_TIME_PICKER_DIFFICULTY`, 11)           | Contact setup difficulty (`AFI_CONTACT_SETUP_DIFFICULTY`, 8)       |
| Accessibility (`FS_ACCESSIBILITY`, 6)                               | Accessibility (`FS_ACCESSIBILITY`, 9)                              |
| Tutorial improvement (`FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT`, 6)                 | Tutorial improvement (`FS_TUTORIAL_IMPROVEMENT`, 4)                |
| Medication tracking (`FS_MEDICATION_TRACKING`, 4)                   | Voice message & notes (`FS_VOICE_MESSAGE_AND_NOTES`, 3)            |

## Theme Summary

Below is a brief description of each theme used in the analysis:

1. **Positive Feedback** – Elements of the app that participants found useful, enjoyable, or supportive during interaction.
2. **Areas for Improvement** – Usability or design issues that hindered smooth interaction or caused confusion.
3. **Feature Suggestions** – New features or enhancements proposed by participants to better support their needs.

## Key Insights

- **Collaboration and Support** – Both persona groups valued features that facilitated collaboration between care receivers and caregivers, such as shared notes and coordinated task management.
- **Tutorial and Guidance** – Onboarding content was appreciated when concise and role-specific, though some participants suggested refinements to improve clarity and relevance.
- **Privacy and Autonomy** – Privacy concerns were frequent, especially regarding location tracking and shared information. Ensuring user control over data sharing was seen as critical.
- **Interface Usability** – Navigation complexity, small touch targets, and hard-to-discover buttons (e.g., save/confirm in the top corner) were recurring issues.
- **Accessibility** – Calls were made for larger text, clearer icons, and alternative input modes (e.g., voice commands) to accommodate varied abilities.
