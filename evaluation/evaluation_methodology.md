# Evaluation Methodology

This document describes the methodology used to evaluate the app using GPT-based personas after development. The aim was to simulate realistic user behavior, identify usability issues, and gather feedback on the app’s design and task flow.

## Purpose

Conducting real usability tests with memory-impaired individuals presents challenges related to safety, accessibility, and recruitment. To address these constraints, GPT-based personas were used to simulate typical users—both memory-impaired individuals and their caregivers. This evaluation phase focused on how these personas interacted with the functional prototype through a simulated Think Aloud test, in contrast to earlier interviews which aimed to explore user needs and expectations.

## Tools and Setup

The evaluation environment was configured as follows:

- **Language Model:** Claude Sonnet 4 was used to simulate persona dialogues which support MCP connection better.
- **iOS Simulator MCP**: Claude was connected to the iOS Simulator using the [iOS Simulator MCP](https://github.com/joshuayoes/ios-simulator-mcp) (Model Context Protocol).
- **Facebook's IDB**: MCP internally used [Facebook’s IDB](https://fbidb.io/) tool to send simulator commands such as tapping, typing, and navigation.
- **Local Server**: A local server managed communication between Claude, the MCP service, and the app.

This setup allowed Claude to interact with the app through natural language instructions. Claude described the user's thoughts and intended actions aloud. These were translated into simulator events via MCP.

## Evaluation Process

### Initial Setup

Before each session:

- The simulator was reset and the app was relaunched.
- A specific persona from the predefined set was selected.
- Where needed, test data (e.g. accounts, linked devices) was preconfigured to reflect each scenario.

### Evaluation Protocol

Each test followed these steps:

1. **Prompt Configuration**  
   Claude was initialized with the persona prompt and instructed to think aloud and act as the persona.
2. **Task Instructions**  
   Claude received a task prompt (if applicable) and was shown the app screen. It described what it saw, what it understood, and what it planned to do.
3. **Action Execution**  
   Based on Claude’s response (e.g., "I would tap the Add Reminder button"), the local server translated the action into simulator input via MCP.
4. **Observation and Logging**  
   Each session was logged, including all screen outputs, user comments, and GPT decisions. Screenshots were recorded at key points.
5. **Post-Task Reflection**  
   Claude answered structured reflection questions to simulate user feedback.

### Observation Criteria

During each session, the following aspects were evaluated:

- Whether the task was completed successfully
- Hesitation or confusion during navigation
- Comments indicating satisfaction, frustration, or misunderstanding

## Prompt

<!-- TODO: add prompt example -->

## Analysis Process

Evaluation logs were analyzed to determine:

- Whether the app flow was intuitive
- Which tasks caused confusion or failure
- Alignment between persona expectations and app behavior
- Emergent feedback or requests for improvement
- Findings were summarized to guide further iteration.

## Limitations

While this method provides early feedback, it does not fully replicate real human behavior. AI agents do not experience physical or emotional responses such as frustration, fatigue, or accessibility challenges. However, it offers valuable insight into design clarity, task flow logic, and potential error cases, particularly when access to real users is limited.

## Full Tasks Designed for Testers

Tasks were based on realistic first-time usage scenarios. Each persona followed a tailored sequence of tasks, as outlined below.

### Stage 1-1: Carereceiver (No Login Required)

**Objective:** Evaluate app comprehension and usability for memory-impaired individuals using the app independently.

| Step | Prompt / Task                                                         | Observation Focus                         |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1    | "This app helps you remember daily things. Please explore it freely." | Initial comprehension without instruction |
| 2    | _(No prompt)_ — allow 2 minutes for free exploration                  | Natural discovery of key features         |
| 3    | "Try adding a task reminder, like ‘Take medicine tomorrow at 8am’."   | Task creation using touch input           |
| 4    | "Try using voice input to create a reminder."                         | Ability to use speech interface           |

**Post-task Questions:**

- Was the app easy to use?
- Was anything hard to use?
- Would you use this in daily life?
- Would you like to share tasks with someone?
- Would you prefer using voice?

### Stage 1-2: Caregiver (Login + Link Required)

**Objective:** Assess the caregiver’s ability to log in, link to a care receiver, and manage shared tasks.

| Step | Prompt / Task                                                                                       | Observation Focus                            |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | "You are a caregiver. This app helps you manage reminders for someone you care for. Please log in." | Ability to complete the login or signup flow |
| 2    | _(No prompt)_ — observe login process                                                               | Completion and ease of login                 |
| 3    | "Add a ‘Take medicine’ reminder for your partner. I’ll act as the care receiver."                   | Task creation process                        |
| 4    | _(No prompt)_ — observe linking process                                                             | Ability to complete account linking          |
| 5    | _(No prompt)_ — observe task management after linking                                               | Understanding of shared task system          |

**Post-task Questions:**

- Was the app easy to use?
- Was anything difficult or confusing?
- Was the feature helpful for caregiving?

### Stage 2: Collaborative Interaction (Pre-linked, Dual Devices)

**Objective:** Evaluate shared task flow and collaborative features between caregiver and carereceiver.

**Prior to evaluation:**

1. Accounts for both caregiver and carereceiver were pre-created and linked.
2. A note titled "Where things are" was added to the carereceiver’s account, containing:
   - Glasses → on the small table by the couch
   - Remote → in the TV drawer
   - Keys → on the hook by the front door
3. A caregiver contact was added.
