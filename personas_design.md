# Persona Design

This document explains how GPT-based personas were created for simulated interviews and evaluations. Eight personas are grouped into four sets, and each set included one memory-impaired individual and up to two caregivers to reflect real caregiving relationships.

Personas were configured with background information such as:

- Age, occupation, and living situation
- Type of memory impairment or caregiving role
- Daily routines, attitudes toward technology, and care preferences
- Communication and emotional traits

## Coverage and Source

- Set 1 was based on the researcher's personal family experience.
- Sets 2 to 4 were adapted from public stories shared on the AlzConnected caregiver forum.

The personas varied by:

- Type and severity of memory impairment
- Living arrangement (shared home, remote care, living alone)
- Relationship to the caregiver (spouse, child, in-law)
- Comfort with mobile technology

## Prompt for Creating Persona

Prompts were given in pairs rather than individually, in order to provide a fuller and more detailed background, making each persona feel more concrete and realistic. The prompt also specified which role each persona was playing.
