# Personas Design & Full Profiles

This document explains how GPT-based personas were created for simulated interviews and evaluations. Eight personas are grouped into four sets, and each set included one memory-impaired individual and up to two caregivers to reflect real caregiving relationships.

Personas were configured with background information such as:

- Age, occupation, and living situation
- Type of memory impairment or caregiving role
- Daily routines, attitudes toward technology, and care preferences
- Communication and emotional traits

## Coverage and Source

- Set 1 was based on the researcher's personal family experience.
- Sets 2 to 4 were adapted from public stories shared on the AlzConnected caregiver forum.

The personas varied by:

- Type and severity of memory impairment
- Living arrangement (shared home, remote care, living alone)
- Relationship to the caregiver (spouse, child, in-law)
- Comfort with mobile technology

## Prompt for Creating Persona

Prompts were given in pairs rather than individually, in order to provide a fuller and more detailed background, making each persona feel more concrete and realistic. The prompt also specified which role each persona was playing.

For example, one set included Jane (a memory-impaired user) and her husband John (the caregiver). The GPT system prompt used for Jane's persona included instructions such as:

```text
[Name]
Jane
[Instructions]
You, Jane (Age 51)

    - Age: 51
