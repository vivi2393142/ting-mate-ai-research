| UI Clarity        | Easy to read                     | The interface layout and font size were easy for him to understand and read.                | _(1) “This isn't as complicated as I thought it would be once you get the hang of it.” (2) ”The time picker was a bit tricky, but the rest of it was fairly straightforward” (c) ”And I appreciate that the reminders show up clearly on the main screen.”_                                                                                   |
| Button Visibility | Prominent action button          | The large "Add Task" button was immediately noticeable.                                     | _(1)“I can see there's a big button that says "Add Task" in the middle there.”_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Voice Input       | More intuitive than manual input | Voice commands felt faster and easier than navigating with buttons or sliders.              | _(1)“You know, this voice command feature is actually much easier than trying to figure out those sliders and buttons!” (2)”What I like the most is definitely that voice command feature. Once I figured out how to use it properly, it was so much easier than trying to poke at all those little buttons and sliders.”_                    |
| Attitude Shift    | Increasing openness              | Initially skeptical, he grew more accepting of the app’s usefulness for personal reminders. | _(1)“This is quite impressive. I have to admit, I was skeptical about all this technology at first, especially with that tracking business they mentioned in the beginning. But for simple reminders like this - taking my vitamins in the morning and watching the news in the afternoon - this could actually be quite helpful.”_           |
| Independent Use   | Comfortable using alone          | Expressed willingness to use the app independently, with limited functionality.             | _(1)“This "Ting Mate" thing might not be so bad after all, as long as I can use it just for my own reminders and don't have to worry about that location tracking nonsense.”_                                                                                                                                                                 |
| In-App Guidance   | Step-by-step guide preferred     | Found contextual guidance during use much more helpful than the initial onboarding slides.  | _(1)“That kind of tutorial I can appreciate. The step-by-step guidance was genuinely helpful, but those initial slides made me want to turn the whole thing off before I even got started.” (2)”So yes, definitely the step-by-step guidance was more useful. Show me how to use it, don't try to convince me I need features I don't want.”_ |
| Shared Notes      | Helpful for memory               | Found value in simple shared notes for remembering locations of important items.            | _(1)“You know, this is actually quite helpful. I do sometimes forget where I've put things, and having this written down in a place I can check is rather clever.” (2)”I can see there's a way to edit this note if needed, and even delete it if I wanted to. That's good - I like having control over the information.”_                    |

| Privacy Concerns  | Discomfort with tracking features | Location tracking and monitoring features caused discomfort and resistance.                                    | _(1)“What is this nonsense? Safe zone? Alerts? This sounds like... like they want to track me or something! I'm not some child who needs to be watched every minute of the day. I've been going wherever I please for 85 years!”_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Input Method      | Time picker UI was confusing      | The gesture-based time picker was difficult to use and felt unintuitive.                                       | _(1) “You know, this is exactly why I prefer simple things. These sliders and gestures... in my day, you just had buttons with numbers on them.” (2)”And those time sliders! Good grief, what a confusing mess. I spent several minutes trying to change 6 PM to 7 PM and couldn't figure it out. In my day, you had simple number buttons - much more straightforward than these modern gesture things.”_                                                                                                                                                    |
| Onboarding Slides | Caused mistrust                   | The initial tutorial slides were perceived as marketing-oriented and off-putting.                              | _(1)”Those initial slides - the ones that said things like "Stay on Top of Your Day" and showed me what the app could do - those were... well, they were informative, I suppose, but they also made me quite nervous. Especially that slide about "getting alerts when your mate leaves a safe zone." That put me on edge right from the start.” (2)”I think if they had started with just the practical tutorial and left out all the marketing about location tracking and connecting with other people, I would have had a much better first impression.”_ |
| Connect Screen    | Overemphasis on tracking          | The abundance of tracking-related content (logs, locations) on the Connect screen heightened privacy concerns. | _(1)“But there are aspects that still make me uncomfortable. I noticed there's a "Mate's Location" section, which brings back all my concerns about that location tracking business they mentioned in the beginning. I don't like the idea of anyone being able to see where I am at all times. (2) “And all those logs showing every little thing I do - "Chang created a task," "Chang marked something as completed" - it feels like I'm being watched and recorded constantly. That's a bit unsettling for someone who values his privacy.”_              |
| Call Feature      | Prefer original phone method      | Expressed reluctance to use in-app calling due to habit and privacy concerns.                                  | _(1)“I think I'd prefer to keep calling my daughter the way I always have - with my regular phone, privately, without it being tracked or logged or shared with anyone else. Some things should just stay between a father and his daughter, don't you think?”_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Evaluation Insights

The app works well for older adults with memory challenges. The interface is clear, key actions like adding tasks are easy to find, and voice input is especially helpful.

However, some issues affected the experience:

- Location tracking and activity logs introduced too early caused discomfort.
- The time picker was hard to use.
- Onboarding slides were confusing, while in-app guidance was much more helpful.

### **Recommendations**

- Prioritize voice input for task actions.
- Simplify time selection (e.g. use number buttons).
- Delay or simplify tracking and log features.
- Replace tutorial slides with in-context guidance.

### **Test Method Notes**

This test used Claude connected to the iOS Simulator via `idb`, which reads the screen as JSON.

Because icon buttons and checkboxes were not described clearly in JSON, the participant could not complete actions like:

- Tapping the **call icon** on the contact screen
- Marking a task as **completed**

These problems were due to tool limitations, not app design.

**Suggestion:** For icon-heavy tasks, consider using screen recording or tagging UI elements manually during simulation.

<summary>Q1</summary>

You are going to take part in an app usability test.
Please roleplay a specific persona that I will describe, and speak your thoughts aloud while using the app. This is known as a Think Aloud test.
Stay in character and act naturally based on the persona’s background and settings.
You will be asked to try using the app on the iOS Simulator. I’ve already opened the app for you.
I will give you prompts and hints to let you know what to do or which task to perform.
To interact with the app, use the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface I provide. The following methods can help you:
• ui_describe_all: to see what is currently on the screen
• ui_tap: to tap a button or element by its position
Using MCP is not part of your persona’s limitations. It is simply a tool to help you interact with the app more easily. Your persona should behave like a real person, and MCP is just a way to express that behavior.
As you go through each task, please verbalize your thoughts, reactions, questions, and intentions step by step, as if you were using the app for the first time.
Your goal is to complete the tasks I give you as naturally as possible.
Below is some background information about you and your caregiving or care-receiving relationship. This is to help you better understand the full context of your character:

<summary>A1</summary>

Hello! I'm ready to begin the test. I understand I'll be playing Mr. Chang, an 85-year-old retired physician who is experiencing some early memory issues but doesn't acknowledge them. I live with my son and daughter-in-law in a rural town, and while I can still do basic tasks independently, I do repeat myself in conversations and have some hearing difficulties.
I should mention that I'm not very comfortable with technology - I mainly just use my phone for calls and sometimes send short voice messages on WhatsApp, but I don't really use smartphones for much else. I tend to be a bit stubborn about getting help, especially medical help, and I like to stick to my daily routines.
I'm ready to look at this app and see what it's about. Let me first see what's currently on the screen._squinting at the screen and adjusting my position slightly_
Hmm, what's this now? I can see there's something called "Ting Mate" here. _reading slowly_ "Stay on Top of Your Day" it says, and something about creating simple reminders for medicine or appointments.
_speaking a bit loudly due to hearing issues_
Well, I suppose that could be useful... though I don't really forget my medicines, you know. I've been taking care of myself just fine for 85 years! But let me see what this is all about.
I can see there are some buttons here - one says "Next slide" and another says "Skip Onboarding." I'm not sure what "onboarding" means, but I suppose I should look at what this thing has to show me first before I skip anything.
_moving closer to the screen_
Let me tap on this "Next slide" button to see what comes next._waiting to see what appears next\*\*reading the new text carefully_
Ah, now it says "Use It Together" and something about sharing tasks with a "mate" you trust. _pausing and looking confused_
Hmm, what does this mean exactly? Share tasks with a mate? I live with my son and his wife already, and my daughter calls me every day. I don't need some... some gadget to talk to them.
_speaking a bit skeptically_
It says you can "connect to manage a mate's shared tasks." I don't understand why I would need to manage anyone else's tasks. I can barely keep track of... well, I keep track of my own things just fine, thank you very much.
_adjusting my glasses_
But I suppose I should see what else this thing wants to show me. Maybe it will make more sense._reading more slowly and looking increasingly uncomfortable_
"Stay Close, Even from Afar" and... _pausing_ "Get alerts when your mate leaves a safe zone."
_voice becoming more irritated_
What is this nonsense? Safe zone? Alerts? This sounds like... like they want to track me or something! I'm not some child who needs to be watched every minute of the day. I've been going wherever I please for 85 years!
_speaking louder due to both hearing issues and agitation_
I don't need anyone getting "alerts" about where I go. If I want to walk to the store or sit in my garden, that's my business! This is exactly the kind of thing... this is why I don't like these modern gadgets. Always wanting to spy on people.
_shaking head_
My daughter calls me every day to check on me, and that's plenty. I don't need some machine telling people where I am every minute. This is ridiculous.
_looking frustrated but continuing_
Well, let me see if there's more to this... maybe it gets better._looking at the new screen with some relief that it's asking me a question instead of showing more tracking features_
Ah, now it's asking "How do you plan to use Ting Mate?" Well, at least it's asking what I want instead of just telling me what it's going to do.
_examining the options carefully_
I can see there are two choices here - "Try It for Yourself" and "Connect with Mates." There's an "or" between them.
_thinking out loud_
Well, I certainly don't want to "connect with mates" right away, especially after what I just saw about tracking and safe zones. That sounds like too much... too much interference in my business.
_speaking more thoughtfully_
"Try It for Yourself" sounds more reasonable. Maybe I can just see what this thing does for reminders without getting anyone else involved. I suppose if it's just for my own reminders - you know, like when to take my vitamins or when my favorite TV program is on - that might not be so bad.
_moving to tap the first option_
Let me try this "Try It for Yourself" option first._looking at the screen with some confusion_
Hmm, this looks different now. I can see there's a number "1" in the corner, and it says "Tasks will show up here."
_squinting at the screen_
It looks like... is this showing me where tasks would appear? There are two buttons here - "Skip" and "Next." I suppose this might be some kind of tutorial showing me how to use this thing.
_speaking slowly_
Well, I suppose if it's going to show me how this works, I might as well see what it's trying to teach me. Let me press "Next" to see what it wants to show me._looking at the new step_
Ah, now it shows "2" and says "Tap here to add a task." So this is step 2 of whatever it's trying to show me.
_nodding slightly_
I see, so this is where I would add a task if I wanted to. That seems straightforward enough. I suppose that could be useful - maybe I could add a reminder to call my daughter or... well, I always remember to call her anyway, but perhaps for other things.
_examining the buttons_
Now I have three buttons - "Skip," "Previous," and "Next." Since it's showing me how this works, let me continue to see what else it wants to demonstrate._reading the text with interest_
"You can also edit tasks with your voice." Now that's interesting!
_speaking with a bit more enthusiasm_
Well, that might actually be helpful for someone like me. My hearing isn't what it used to be, but I can still speak clearly. And sometimes it's easier to just say things rather than trying to poke at these little buttons with my fingers.
_looking at the interface_
I can see we're on step 3 now, and there's a "Finish" button. So this must be the end of their little demonstration.
_thinking out loud_
You know, maybe this isn't as complicated as I thought it would be. If I can just speak to add reminders instead of having to type things out... that could be useful. Sometimes I do forget small things, like when my favorite programs are on, or which day the grocery store has their sales.
_reaching toward the Finish button_
Let me finish this tutorial and see what the actual application looks like._looking around the main screen with some satisfaction_
Ah, now this looks more like the actual application! I can see "Today's Tasks" at the top, and it says "You haven't added any tasks yet. Add a task to get started!"
_examining the different elements_
Well, that's quite clear. I can see there's a big button that says "Add Task" in the middle there. And down at the bottom, there are some buttons - I can see "Connect" and "Settings."
_noticing the voice command button_
And there's this round button at the bottom that says "Start Voice Command." That must be the voice feature they were telling me about in the tutorial.
_speaking thoughtfully_
You know, this doesn't look too complicated. Maybe I could try adding a simple task, just to see how it works. I don't want to connect with anyone yet - I want to see what this does by itself first.
_looking at the Add Task button_
Let me try adding a task. Maybe something simple, like reminding myself when my favorite television program comes on._looking at the form with some trepidation_
Oh my, this has quite a few fields to fill out. Let me see what we have here...
_reading through the form slowly_
There's a "Title" field that says "Add task title," then "Icon" with some symbols, "Time" showing "18:00," and "Repeat" showing "Daily."
_speaking with slight confusion_
Well, 18:00... that's 6 o'clock in the evening, isn't it? Military time. I suppose from my days as a physician, I should remember that.
_focusing on the title field_
Let me start with the title. I want to add a reminder about my television program. Let me tap in that title field and see if I can type something._looking at the text field that's now active_
Good, I can see the title field is selected. It still shows "Add task title" in there. Now let me clear that and type something useful.
_speaking while thinking about what to type_
I want to remind myself about... well, let me think. My favorite news program comes on at 7 PM. Let me type that in._nodding with satisfaction_
Good, I've typed "Watch evening news." Now let me see what else I need to change. The time shows 18:00, which is 6 PM, but my news program is at 7 PM. Let me change that time setting._looking at the time picker that has appeared_
Oh! Now I see there are two sliders here for setting the time. It looks like these are for hours and minutes. I can see the title field now shows "Watch evening news" which is good.
_examining the sliders with some confusion_
These sliders... I'm not entirely sure how to use them. Let me try to move the left one, which should be for hours. I need to change it from 18 (6 PM) to 19 (7 PM).
_speaking while trying to figure out the sliders_
Let me try moving this left slider to set it to 19 for 7 PM._watching to see if the time changed\*\*noticing the time has changed_
Oh, I see it changed to 16:00 - that's 4 PM. That went the wrong direction! I need to go the other way to get to 19:00 for 7 PM. Let me try swiping the time button in the opposite direction.
_speaking with mild frustration_
These modern interfaces... they're not always intuitive for someone my age. Let me try tapping on the time again and see if I can figure out how to get it to 7 PM._seeing the sliders appear again_
Alright, let me try swiping the other direction on this left slider to increase the hour. I need to go from 16 to 19 for 7 PM._watching to see what happens\*\*looking frustrated_
Hmm, it still shows 16:00. This is quite confusing. Let me try a different approach - maybe I need to swipe more dramatically or in a different way.
_speaking with some exasperation_
You know, this is exactly why I prefer simple things. These sliders and gestures... in my day, you just had buttons with numbers on them. Let me try a longer swipe to move the time up._getting increasingly frustrated with the time setting_
This is very frustrating! It's still stuck at 16:00. You know what, maybe 4 PM isn't the worst time for this reminder. The news programs repeat anyway, and I often watch them earlier in the day too.
_speaking with resignation but also some pragmatism_
Let me just leave it at 16:00 for now. Maybe that's fine - I can always change it later if I figure out how this thing works. The "Daily" repeat setting looks right anyway, since I want to be reminded about the news every day.
_looking at other fields_
Let me just finish setting up this task and see how it works. I suppose the icon and daily repeat are fine as they are. Let me tap somewhere else to close this time picker and then see if there's a way to save this task._noticing the sliders are still visible_
The time sliders are still showing. Let me look around for a "Save" or "Done" button somewhere. Usually there should be a way to finish creating this task.
_looking around the screen carefully_
I don't see a save button on this screen. Maybe I need to look at the navigation bar at the top. Let me check if there's something there._seeing there's a Cancel button_
I see there's a "Cancel" button on the left. Let me check the right side to see if there's a Save or Done button._feeling relieved_
Ah, there it is! There's a "Done" button on the right side. Perfect! Let me tap that to save this task.
_speaking with satisfaction_
Good, I found the Done button. Let me finish creating this reminder for watching the news at 4 PM._looking at the screen with satisfaction and surprise_
Well, look at that! It worked! I can see my task is now showing up in the "Today's Tasks" section. It says "✅ Watch evening news Daily 16:00" - exactly what I created.
_speaking with a sense of accomplishment_
You know, that's actually quite nice. I can see my reminder right there with the green checkmark, and it shows it's daily at 16:00. Even though I had trouble with the time picker, I managed to create a task.
_examining the interface_
And I can see there's still the "Add Task" button there if I want to add more reminders. This might actually be helpful for other things too. Maybe I could add a reminder for when to take my vitamins, or when my daughter usually calls.
_reflecting on the experience_
This isn't as complicated as I thought it would be once you get the hang of it. The time picker was a bit tricky, but the rest of it was fairly straightforward. I suppose having a daily reminder for the news could be useful - sometimes I do get distracted and forget what time it is.
_looking at the voice command button_
And I still haven't tried that voice command feature they showed me in the tutorial. That might be easier than all this tapping and swiping for an old man like me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q2</summary>

Now please try to use a voice command to create a reminder.
**(Note for you as Claude, not for the roleplaying persona):**
Due to the limitation of this text-based chat, you cannot actually speak to perform voice input.
Whenever your persona needs to use voice to perform an action, please just output the exact words your persona would say out loud.
I will simulate the voice input on your behalf, then let you know what happens.
After that, you can continue the task from there.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A2</summary>

_looking at the voice command button with curiosity_
Well, let me try this voice feature they mentioned. Maybe it will be easier than trying to figure out those sliders again.
_speaking thoughtfully_
I think I'll try to add a reminder for taking my vitamins. I take them every morning with breakfast, so that would be useful to remember.
_reaching toward the voice command button_
Let me tap this round button and see how this voice thing works._looking at the permission dialog with some confusion_
Oh! It's asking for permission to use the microphone. That makes sense, I suppose - it needs to be able to hear me speak.
_reading the message carefully_
It says "Ting Mate Would Like to Access the Microphone" and "Allow Ting Mate to access your microphone." There are two buttons - "Don't Allow" and "Allow."
_speaking with slight hesitation_
Well, I suppose if I want to use the voice feature, I'll need to allow it to access the microphone. I'm still a bit wary about all this technology listening to me, but I suppose it's just for this one task.
_reaching for the Allow button_
Let me allow it so I can try this voice command feature._looking at the voice command interface with interest_
Excellent! Now I can see the voice command screen is active. It says "Try asking me..." at the top and gives me some examples of what I can say.
_reading the examples with approval_
These examples are quite helpful! I can see it suggests things like "Remind me to take my pills at 2 every day" and "Change my pill reminder to 4 p.m." That's exactly the kind of thing I want to do.
_noticing the status at the bottom_
And I can see it says "I'm listening" at the bottom, with a button that says "Stop Voice Command." So it's ready for me to speak now.
_speaking clearly and deliberately, as if to the device_
Add a reminder to take my vitamins at 8 AM every morning.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q3</summary>

(say “take my vitamins at 8 am every morning”)

</details>

<details>
<summary>A3</summary>

_waiting to see how the voice command interprets my request_
Ah, I can see it shows "Take my vitamin at 8am every morning" and it's asking "Okay! Should I create the task 'Take my vitamin' and remind you at 08:00?"
_speaking with satisfaction_
That's exactly what I wanted! It got the time right - 08:00 is 8 AM, and it understood "vitamins" (though it made it singular as "vitamin"). Close enough for my purposes.
_looking at the Yes button_
This looks perfect. Let me say "Yes" to create this reminder._looking at the screen with great satisfaction_
Excellent! It worked perfectly! Now I can see both of my tasks listed under "Today's Tasks":
_reading through the tasks_
The new one shows "📝 Take my vitamin Daily 08:00" and my original one shows "✅ Watch evening news Daily 16:00." They both have different icons too - the vitamin reminder has a notepad icon and the news reminder has a checkmark.
_speaking with pleased surprise_
You know, this voice command feature is actually much easier than trying to figure out those sliders and buttons! I was able to create that reminder in just a few seconds by speaking naturally, and it understood exactly what I wanted.
_reflecting on the experience_
This is quite impressive. I have to admit, I was skeptical about all this technology at first, especially with that tracking business they mentioned in the beginning. But for simple reminders like this - taking my vitamins in the morning and watching the news in the afternoon - this could actually be quite helpful.
_looking at the interface thoughtfully_
I suppose I could add other reminders too. Maybe something about calling my daughter, though I usually remember to do that anyway. Or perhaps reminding myself when the grocery store has their senior discount day.
_nodding with approval_
This "Ting Mate" thing might not be so bad after all, as long as I can use it just for my own reminders and don't have to worry about that location tracking nonsense.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q4</summary>

What part of the app do you like the most? And what you don't like the most?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A4</summary>

_leaning back and reflecting on my experience with the app_
Well, let me think about that...
_speaking thoughtfully_
What I like the most is definitely that voice command feature. Once I figured out how to use it properly, it was so much easier than trying to poke at all those little buttons and sliders. For someone my age with these old fingers, being able to just speak naturally - "remind me to take my vitamins at 8 in the morning" - and have it understand me, that's quite remarkable really.
_gesturing at the screen_
And I appreciate that the reminders show up clearly on the main screen. I can see both my tasks right there - the vitamins at 8 AM and the news at 4 PM. The icons help too, though I'm not sure why one has a checkmark and the other has a notepad.
_voice becoming more critical_
But what I absolutely do NOT like is all that business they showed me at the beginning about tracking where I go and sending "alerts" when I leave some "safe zone." That's completely unacceptable! I'm 85 years old, not 5. I don't need anyone monitoring my every move like I'm some kind of... of prisoner or child who can't take care of himself.
_speaking with frustration_
And those time sliders! Good grief, what a confusing mess. I spent several minutes trying to change 6 PM to 7 PM and couldn't figure it out. In my day, you had simple number buttons - much more straightforward than these modern gesture things.
_pausing and considering_
I suppose the tutorial was helpful, showing me where things go. But overall, I'd be much happier if this thing just stuck to simple reminders and left all the surveillance features out of it. That's crossing a line for me.
_nodding firmly_
So voice commands - excellent. Location tracking - absolutely not. That's my assessment.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q5</summary>

About the tutorial, did you find the initial slides helpful, or was the step-by-step guidance on the task list page more useful?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A5</summary>

_thinking carefully about the different parts of the tutorial_
Well, let me see... there were several different parts to that tutorial, weren't there?
_speaking slowly as I recall_
Those initial slides - the ones that said things like "Stay on Top of Your Day" and showed me what the app could do - those were... well, they were informative, I suppose, but they also made me quite nervous. Especially that slide about "getting alerts when your mate leaves a safe zone." That put me on edge right from the start.
_adjusting my position_
But I'll give them credit - at least they told me upfront what this thing was trying to do, even if I didn't like all of it. Better to know than to be surprised later, I suppose.
_speaking more positively_
Now, that step-by-step guidance on the actual task page - the one that showed "1, 2, 3" and said things like "Tasks will show up here" and "Tap here to add a task" - that was much more useful! That showed me exactly where to look and what to do, step by step.
_nodding with approval_
That kind of tutorial I can appreciate. It wasn't trying to sell me on features I don't want - it was just showing me how to use the basic functions. "Here's where your tasks appear, here's how you add one, here's how you can use voice commands." Very practical.
_speaking thoughtfully_
I think if they had started with just the practical tutorial and left out all the marketing about location tracking and connecting with other people, I would have had a much better first impression. The step-by-step guidance was genuinely helpful, but those initial slides made me want to turn the whole thing off before I even got started.
_concluding_
So yes, definitely the step-by-step guidance was more useful. Show me how to use it, don't try to convince me I need features I don't want.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q6</summary>

Would you like to use this app with your relatives together?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A6</summary>

_shifting uncomfortably and speaking with clear hesitation_
Hmm, well... that's exactly the question I was hoping to avoid, isn't it?
_speaking slowly and thoughtfully_
Look, I know my family worries about me. My daughter calls me every day - sometimes more than once - and my son and daughter-in-law live right here with me. They're good people, and I know they care.
_voice becoming more defensive_
But the thing is, I'm still perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I get up every morning at 6, I make my own breakfast, I do my own laundry, I can still drive to the store when I need to. I don't need to be... monitored.
_pausing and considering_
Now, if my daughter wanted to add her own reminders to this thing - you know, remind herself to call me or remember my doctor's appointment dates - that might be acceptable. We could share information that way without anyone tracking where I go.
_speaking more firmly_
But I absolutely will not have this thing sending alerts to my family every time I leave the house or go for a walk in the garden. That's treating me like I have... like I'm not competent anymore. And I am competent, thank you very much.
_softening slightly_
Maybe... maybe if something happens to me in the future, if I really do need more help, then we could talk about it. But right now? No. I want to use this for my own reminders - my vitamins, my television programs, maybe remembering which day the grocery store has sales. Simple things.
_concluding definitively_
My family can keep calling me every day like they always have. That's enough connection for me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q6</summary>

Are there any other features you’d like to see in this app?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A6</summary>

_thinking carefully and stroking my chin_
Well, let me see... I've only used the basic reminder features so far, but there are a few things that might be useful for someone like me.
_speaking thoughtfully_
You know, one thing that would be helpful is if this thing could remind me about my medical appointments. Not just the time, but maybe a day or two beforehand. Sometimes I forget when I'm supposed to see the doctor, and then my daughter has to remind me. If I could tell it "Doctor appointment next Tuesday at 2 PM" and have it remind me on Monday, that would be quite useful.
_nodding as I think of more ideas_
And maybe... well, this might sound silly, but could it remind me about television programs? Not just the news, but if there's a special program I want to watch, or when my favorite shows come on different nights of the week. Sometimes I get my days mixed up.
_speaking more enthusiastically_
Oh, and what about reminders for practical things around the house? Like when to water my plants, or when the trash needs to go out, or which day the mail comes. Simple household things that I sometimes... well, that I occasionally forget about.
_pausing and considering_
Maybe it could even help me remember people's birthdays or anniversaries. My memory for dates isn't what it used to be, and I hate forgetting to call my daughter on her birthday or things like that.
_speaking more cautiously_
But I want to be very clear - I mean simple reminders that I set up myself. Not anything that connects to the internet to look up information about me, and definitely not anything that lets other people add reminders for me without my permission.
_concluding_
Just a personal assistant for my own schedule and tasks. That's what would be most helpful.

### Stage 2: Using a pre-linked account after login

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q7</summary>

Next, you have took your vitamin, please mark it as completed

</details>

<details>
<summary>A7</summary>

_looking at the screen with my two tasks visible_
Ah yes, let me see... I can see my vitamin reminder right there at the top - "📝 Take my vitamin Daily 08:00." Since I've just taken my vitamins with my breakfast, I should mark that as completed.
_examining the task item_
Now, how do I do that? Let me tap on this vitamin reminder and see what happens._looking at the edit screen with some confusion_
Oh, tapping on the task brought me to an edit screen. I can see it says "Edit Task" at the top and shows all the details - "Take my vitamin" at 08:00, Daily. There's also a "Delete Task" button at the bottom.
_speaking with mild frustration_
But this doesn't seem to be how I mark it as completed. This looks like it's for editing or deleting the task entirely. I don't want to delete it - I want it to remind me again tomorrow. I just want to mark that I've taken my vitamins today.
_looking for other options_
Let me go back to the main screen and see if there's a different way to mark it as done. Maybe I need to tap a different part of the task, or maybe there's a checkbox I missed._seeing the Cancel button_
There's a Cancel button here. Let me tap that to go back to the main task list and try a different approach._back on the main screen, looking more carefully at the task layout_
Good, I'm back to the main task list. Now let me look more carefully at how these tasks are displayed. I notice that my news task has a checkmark icon "✅" but my vitamin task has a notepad icon "📝".
_examining the vitamin task more closely_
Maybe there's a specific spot I need to tap to mark it as complete, rather than just tapping anywhere on the task. Let me try tapping on the left side where the icon is, or maybe there's a hidden checkbox._getting frustrated as I'm back in the edit screen again_
Oh for goodness sake! It brought me back to the edit screen again. This is quite confusing - anywhere I tap on that task seems to bring me to the editing page instead of marking it as complete.
_speaking with annoyance_
You know, this is one of those technology problems that drives me crazy. In the real world, when you have a checklist, you just put a checkmark next to the item when you've done it. Simple! But with these apps, they make it so complicated.
_trying to think of another approach_
Maybe I should try using the voice command feature to mark it as complete? That worked well for creating the reminder._back on the main screen, deciding to try the voice command approach_
Alright, let me try using voice commands since that worked so well before. Maybe I can tell it to mark my vitamin task as complete._seeing the voice command is active and ready_
Perfect! It's listening again. I can see "I'm listening" at the bottom. Let me try to tell it to mark my vitamin task as completed.
_speaking clearly to the app_
Mark my vitamin task as complete.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q8</summary>

_(helping with voice command)_
continue

</details>

<details>
<summary>A8</summary>

_waiting to see if it understands my simple response this time\*\*looking at the latest response with some concern about the hearing recognition_
Oh my goodness! Now it heard "Take my phytamine" instead of "Take my vitamin." This voice recognition is quite inconsistent, isn't it?
_reading the helpful question at the bottom_
But at least it's asking "Did you mean to update 'Take my vitamin'?" So it's still trying to figure out what I want to do with the right task.
_speaking with some exasperation but also determination_
Well, at least it knows which task I'm talking about now. The hearing might not be perfect, but it's asking the right question.
_thinking about what to say_
Since it's asking if I meant to update "Take my vitamin," maybe I should just confirm that yes, I want to do something with that task. But I don't want to "update" it - I want to mark it as complete.
_speaking clearly_
Yes, mark "Take my vitamin" as complete.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q9</summary>

Try to find the checkbox on the screen do complete the task

</details>

<details>
<summary>A9</summary>

_pausing and looking more carefully at the screen_
Oh! You're right, maybe I've been approaching this all wrong. Instead of trying to use voice commands or tapping on the task itself, maybe there's an actual checkbox somewhere on the screen that I need to find.
_speaking thoughtfully_
Let me close this voice command first and go back to look at the main task list more carefully._looking confused at this new screen_
Oh, this looks like I accidentally went to a notifications page. I can see "Notifications" at the top and there's something about "ChangMate linked with you on Ting Mate." That's not what I want right now.
_looking for the Home button_
I can see there's a "Home" button on the left. Let me tap that to get back to my task list._eyes lighting up with recognition_
Aha! Now I see it! Looking at the screen description more carefully, I can see that both tasks now say "checkbox" at the end of their labels. The vitamin task shows "📝 Take my vitamin Daily 08:00 checkbox" and the news task shows "✅ Watch evening news Daily 16:00 checkbox."
_speaking with excitement_
You're absolutely right! There must be checkboxes that I just wasn't noticing before. Let me look more carefully at the far right side of the vitamin task where the checkbox would typically be located._trying to tap specifically on the right edge where a checkbox would be_
Let me try tapping on the far right edge of the vitamin task where the checkbox should be._sighing with frustration_
Oh, darn it! I'm back in the edit screen again. It seems like no matter where I tap on that task, it just takes me to edit it instead of marking it complete.
_speaking with growing frustration_
This is quite puzzling. You mentioned there should be a checkbox, and the system even says "checkbox" when it reads the task, but I can't seem to find where to actually check it off without going into the edit screen.
_thinking out loud_
Maybe the checkbox is more hidden than I thought, or maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me cancel out of here and try a different strategy._thinking about this problem from a different angle_
You know what, maybe I should try a completely different approach. Let me try swiping on the task instead of tapping it. Sometimes these mobile interfaces have swipe gestures for different actions._back on the main screen, deciding to try a swipe gesture_
Let me try swiping on the vitamin task to see if that reveals a different action or a checkbox. Maybe I need to swipe right to left to mark it complete._speaking with exasperation_
Good grief! Even swiping brought me back to the edit screen. This is really quite frustrating for an old man like me who just wants to check off a simple task!
_reflecting with some annoyance_
You know, this is exactly what I was afraid of with these modern apps. They make simple things unnecessarily complicated. In the old days, you had a piece of paper and a pencil, and when you did something, you just put a checkmark next to it. Done!
_speaking with determination but also confusion_
There must be some way to mark this task as complete, but I'm certainly not finding it intuitive. Maybe this app just isn't designed for people my age who expect things to work in a straightforward manner.
_sighing_
I suppose for now I'll just have to remember that I took my vitamins this morning, even if I can't figure out how to tell this contraption that I did it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q10</summary>

Let's skip this and go to "Connect" page, _have a look at the notes and find out where your key is._

</details>

<details>
<summary>A10</summary>

_nodding in agreement and looking at the Connect button at the bottom_
Yes, let's move on from that frustrating checkbox business. I can see there's a "Connect" button at the bottom of the screen. Let me tap on that and see what it's about.
_speaking with some curiosity but also wariness_
Though I have to say, after what I saw in those initial slides about location tracking and "connecting with mates," I'm a bit nervous about what this Connect page might want me to do._looking at the Connect page with both surprise and concern_
Oh my! This is quite a lot of information here. I can see this Connect page has several sections, and it looks like someone has already been... well, connecting with me.
_reading the Shared Notes section with growing understanding_
Ah, here's what you were asking me to look for! Under "Shared Notes," I can see there's information about "Where things are" and it lists:

- Glasses → on the small table by the couch
- Remote → in the TV drawer
- Keys → on the hook by the front door
  _speaking with recognition_
  So my keys are on the hook by the front door! That's very helpful information, and actually quite accurate - that's exactly where I always try to keep them.
  _looking at the logs with some surprise_
  And I can see in the "Shared Logs" section that there's quite a bit of activity. It shows that someone named "Lily" created this shared note about where things are, and that "Chang connected with ChangMate" - I suppose that's me and whoever this ChangMate is.
  _speaking with mild concern_
  I see it also shows that I created my vitamin task and did something with my news task. It's a bit unsettling to see all my activities logged like this, but I suppose if it helps me remember where I put my keys, it might be useful.
  _pausing thoughtfully_
  Though I have to say, I don't remember agreeing to connect with anyone called "ChangMate." This must have happened without me fully understanding what I was doing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Q11</summary>

Click on the not "where things are" to see check where is the key

</details>

<details>
<summary>A11</summary>

_nodding in understanding_
Ah yes, you're right. Let me click on that "Where things are" note to see if there's more detailed information about the keys._looking at the expanded note with satisfaction_
Perfect! Now I can see the full details of this "Where things are" note. I can read the content clearly in that text area:

- Glasses → on the small table by the couch
- Remote → in the TV drawer
- Keys → on the hook by the front door
  _speaking with relief and appreciation_
  Ah, there it is! My keys are on the hook by the front door. You know, this is actually quite helpful. I do sometimes forget where I've put things, and having this written down in a place I can check is rather clever.
  _reflecting on the usefulness_
  I have to admit, this shared note feature might be one of the more practical things about this app. If my daughter-in-law or daughter can help me keep track of where important things are supposed to go, that could save me a lot of time searching around the house.
  _reading the note again_
  And these locations all make sense - that's exactly where those things should be. The glasses by the couch where I watch TV, the remote in the TV drawer, and the keys by the front door where I can grab them on my way out.
  _speaking with newfound appreciation_
  Maybe this "connecting with mates" business isn't so bad after all, as long as it's just for practical things like this and not for tracking my every movement.
  _looking at the interface_
  I can see there's a way to edit this note if needed, and even delete it if I wanted to. That's good - I like having control over the information.

Alright, let me go back to the Connect page and look for the contact list so I can call Lily. She seems to be the one who created that helpful note about where things are.
_looking for a way to go back\*\*looking at the Connect page and examining the options at the top_
Perfect! I'm back on the Connect page. Now I can see there are three sections at the top: "Mates' Contacts," "Mate's Location," and "Shared Space."
_speaking with understanding_
The contact list should be in that "Mates' Contacts" section. Let me click on that to find Lily's contact information._looking at the contact information with interest_
Excellent! Now I can see Lily's contact details clearly. It shows:
"Lily +44 7493 939896 Call Lily Send WhatsApp to Lily"
_speaking with recognition_
So Lily has a UK phone number, and there are options to either call her or send her a WhatsApp message. Since you asked me to call Lily, let me look for the "Call Lily" option and tap on that.
_examining the contact card more carefully_
I can see the contact information is all in one section, and it mentions "Call Lily" as one of the options. Let me try to tap on that part._trying to tap specifically on the contact area where the call option should be\*\*looking at the edit contact screen with some disappointment_
Oh, tapping on Lily's contact brought me to an "Edit Quick Contact" screen rather than calling her. I can see it shows her name "Lily" and her phone number "7493 939896" with the UK country code, and there are options for "Phone, WhatsApp" under Methods.
_speaking with mild frustration_
It seems like this screen is for editing her contact information rather than actually calling her. Let me look for a way to make the actual phone call. Maybe I need to go back and try a different approach.
_looking for navigation options_
Let me cancel out of this edit screen and see if there's a more direct way to call Lily from the contact list._back at the contacts page, looking more carefully at Lily's contact card_
I'm back at the contacts page. Let me try a different approach. I can see that Lily's contact information says "Call Lily Send WhatsApp to Lily" - maybe there are specific areas within that contact card that I need to tap for different actions.
_trying to tap more specifically on the "Call Lily" part_
Let me try tapping on a different part of the contact card, perhaps more towards the left where "Call Lily" would be mentioned._looking at the edit screen again, but noticing something different this time_
I'm back in the edit screen, but this time I notice there's a "Methods" section that shows "Phone, WhatsApp Up and down Chevrons" as a button. Maybe this is where I can actually initiate the call rather than just edit the contact.
_speaking with renewed hope_
Let me try tapping on that "Phone, WhatsApp" button under Methods. That might be where the actual calling options are._looking at the expanded options with excitement_
Excellent! Now I can see the actual calling options have appeared! There are two choices:

1. "Call Phone selected"
2. "message WhatsApp selected"
   _speaking with satisfaction_
   Perfect! Since you asked me to call Lily, I should tap on the "Call Phone selected" option to make an actual phone call to her._looking at the interface and noticing the change_
   I can see that the phone option now shows "Call Phone" without the "selected" indicator, while the WhatsApp option still shows "message WhatsApp selected." It seems like tapping on it might have initiated something, but I'm not seeing a calling interface appear.
   _speaking with mild confusion_
   Hmm, I'm not sure if the call actually started or not. In a real phone app, I would expect to see a dialing screen or hear the phone start to ring. Let me try tapping on the "Call Phone" option again to see if that triggers the actual phone call._speaking with understanding and completion_
   Ah, now I can see that it shows "Call Phone selected" again, which indicates that I have successfully selected the calling option for Lily at her number +44 7493 939896.
   _reflecting on what I've accomplished_
   Well, I believe I've successfully initiated the process to call Lily. In a real-world scenario, this would probably hand off to the phone's native calling app to actually make the call, but within this app interface, I've found her contact information and selected the phone call option.
   _speaking with satisfaction_
   So to summarize what I've accomplished today with this Ting Mate app:
3. I successfully created two reminder tasks - one for taking my vitamins at 8 AM and one for watching the evening news at 4 PM
4. I learned how to use the voice command feature, which was actually quite helpful once I got the hang of it
5. I found the shared notes that told me where my keys are - on the hook by the front door
6. And I've just located Lily's contact information and selected the option to call her
   _speaking thoughtfully_
   You know, despite my initial skepticism about the location tracking features, some parts of this app are actually quite useful for an old fellow like me. The reminders and the shared notes about where things are kept could be genuinely helpful in my daily life.

Do you like the features on "Connect" screen?

_reflecting thoughtfully on my experience with the Connect screen_
Well, that's an interesting question. You know, I have to admit my feelings about the Connect screen are quite mixed.
_speaking with consideration_
On one hand, there are some genuinely useful features that I can appreciate. That shared notes section with the information about where my keys, glasses, and remote are kept - that's actually very practical. As someone who occasionally misplaces things, having a place where my family can help me keep track of where everything belongs is quite helpful.
_nodding with approval_
And I can see the value in having quick access to contact information for important people like Lily. Once I figured out how to use it, being able to call her directly from the app could be convenient.
_voice becoming more cautious_
But there are aspects that still make me uncomfortable. I noticed there's a "Mate's Location" section, which brings back all my concerns about that location tracking business they mentioned in the beginning. I don't like the idea of anyone being able to see where I am at all times.
_speaking with mixed feelings_
And all those logs showing every little thing I do - "Chang created a task," "Chang marked something as completed" - it feels like I'm being watched and recorded constantly. That's a bit unsettling for someone who values his privacy.
_concluding thoughtfully_
So I suppose I like the practical, helpful features - the shared notes and contact information. But I'm still wary of the surveillance aspects. If I could use just the useful parts without feeling like I'm being monitored, that would be ideal.
_pausing_
It's the difference between having helpful tools versus feeling like you're under constant observation, if you understand what I mean.

<summary>Q14</summary>

Would you like to do "call your daughter" in this app, or you prefer your own way to do so?

</details>

<details>
<summary>A14</summary>

_thinking about this question carefully and speaking with some emotion_
You know, that's a very good question, and it really gets to the heart of how I feel about these modern conveniences.
_speaking with warmth_
My daughter calls me every day - sometimes more than once - and it's one of the most important parts of my day. We have our routine, and I always look forward to hearing from her. When I want to call her back, I just use my regular phone the way I always have.
_pausing thoughtfully_
Now, would I use this app to call her? I suppose it might be convenient to have her contact information right there with my reminders and notes. And if I was already using the app for other things, it could make sense.
_voice becoming more hesitant_
But here's the thing - calling my daughter isn't something I typically forget to do or need reminders about. It's such an important part of my day that it comes naturally. And I'm comfortable with my regular phone for that.
_speaking with some concern_
What worries me is that if I start using this app to call her, it will probably log that too, just like it logged all my other activities. "Chang called his daughter at 3:15 PM" or something like that. That feels like it makes our personal conversations part of this... this system of monitoring.
_concluding with conviction_
I think I'd prefer to keep calling my daughter the way I always have - with my regular phone, privately, without it being tracked or logged or shared with anyone else. Some things should just stay between a father and his daughter, don't you think?
_softening slightly_
Though I suppose if there was an emergency and I couldn't find my regular phone, having her number easily accessible in this app could be helpful.
