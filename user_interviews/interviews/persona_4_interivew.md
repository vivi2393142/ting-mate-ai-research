## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe what a normal day looks like for you?</summary>

I usually start my day early with a walk with my dog. That helps me clear my head and get moving. After that, I do some light strength training or cardio. I try to keep my mornings structured. Midday, I might do some speaking prep, respond to messages, or take part in Alzheimer's awareness events. I eat meals at regular times to keep things consistent. Evenings are quieter—I'll relax, maybe watch a show, and wind down early.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does anyone help you with your daily routine? If so, how do they assist you?</summary>

I live independently, but I have a good support system. My sister checks in most days by text or call. Friends help by reminding me about events or appointments if I need a nudge. They don't do things for me, just keep me on track when needed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you use anything to help you remember things, like notes, alarms, or reminders from people?</summary>

Yes, absolutely. I use my phone a lot—alarms, calendar reminders, and sticky notes around the house. I also set timers when I cook or even when I start laundry, just in case I get distracted.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What things do you forget most often?</summary>

Names, appointments, sometimes even what I was just doing. It's frustrating when I walk into a room and forget why I went in there. I also sometimes forget conversations I had the day before.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>Are there times when forgetting something causes problems or stress for you?</summary>

Yes, especially when I miss something important—like a doctor's appointment—or when I repeat myself and realize it after. It makes me feel embarrassed, even though I know I shouldn't be.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you sometimes feel confused or unsure about what's happening during the day?</summary>

Yes, that happens more when I'm tired or overwhelmed. I can lose track of the time or the order of things I was supposed to do.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When you forget something, how do you usually handle it?</summary>

I try to pause and breathe. If I'm with someone, I ask them to remind me. If I'm alone, I'll check my phone or notes. Sometimes I just let it go if it's not that important.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you use a smartphone or tablet? What do you use it for?</summary>

Yes, I use both. My phone is my main tool—calendar, reminders, texting, taking pictures of things I want to remember, and even tracking my workouts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever used any apps to remind you of things?</summary>

Yes. I use the calendar app, Google Keep for notes, and a medication reminder app.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When using apps, what makes them easy or difficult for you?</summary>

Simple is best. Big buttons, clear instructions. Too many options or too much text confuses me. I like when something walks me through a task, step-by-step.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When texting or using app, you prefer to use voice control or touch control?</summary>

I use both. Voice is helpful when I'm too tired to type, but sometimes it misunderstands me. I like having both options.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you want from your daily life?</summary>

I'd like help staying on top of appointments, meals, and remembering names. Encouragement helps too—those little "you're doing great" nudges.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you not want?</summary>

I don't want people doing everything for me. I need to feel independent. I'd rather have tools that support me, not take over.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there tasks you prefer to do on your own? What tasks would you rather someone help you with?</summary>

I like doing my own meals, walks, and personal tasks. But I appreciate reminders about events or when paperwork needs handling.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it be helpful to have gentle reminders for important things, like meals or medicine?</summary>

Definitely. Especially if it can come with a kind tone, not just a buzzing alarm.

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What do you think about this kind of app?</summary>

I think it sounds great. Honestly, something like that would make my days smoother and give me more confidence.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would you like to try using something like this?</summary>

Yes, I would. Especially if it's easy to set up and doesn't overload me with too much at once.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What would you want this app to do for you?</summary>

Remind me about meals, medicine, and appointments
Keep track of my day in a simple way
Maybe even give encouraging messages now and then
Help me reconnect if I get lost or confused (even a "what's next?" button)

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

Is it hard to set up?
Will I need someone else to manage it for me?
Will it be overwhelming with too many notifications?
Does it respect my privacy and not share things without my say-so?
