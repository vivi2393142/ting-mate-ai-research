## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe what a normal day looks like for you?</summary>

Well, I usually wake up when the sun's already out—no alarm needed anymore. I make myself some tea, maybe a little toast or oatmeal. Then I sit in the living room for a bit, maybe flip through the paper or watch the news. I try to do a bit around the house—like tidying or sorting through the mail—but my body doesn't always cooperate. My arthritis has been awful lately. By afternoon, I'm usually resting. I might try to cook something small for dinner, unless Ally gets home first.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does anyone help you with your daily routine? If so, how do they assist you?</summary>

Yes, Ally helps with most things. She handles the groceries, the cooking when I can't, the cleaning—though I try to do my bit. She reminds me to take my medicine and checks the calendar for me. She even helps me when I get stuck using my phone.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you use anything to help you remember things, like notes, alarms, or reminders from people?</summary>

Sometimes I write things down. Sticky notes on the fridge, mostly. Ally sets the timer or reminders on the phone for my pills. And she tells me things more than once when I forget. She's patient—well, most days.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What things do you forget most often?</summary>

I forget where I put things. Like the keys, or my purse, or the tea tin. And sometimes I forget what day it is or whether I've taken my medicine. And people's names... I forget those, even family.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>Are there times when forgetting something causes problems or stress for you?</summary>

Oh yes. Especially when I misplace something important. Like the remote or my glasses. Then I feel like a fool tearing up the living room looking for it, only to find it where I left it. And it bothers me when Ally notices before I do.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you sometimes feel confused or unsure about what's happening during the day?</summary>

Sometimes, yes. I'll sit there wondering what I'm supposed to be doing next, or I'll be halfway through something and completely lose track of why I started. It's like the wires just don't connect.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When you forget something, how do you usually handle it?</summary>

Well, I try not to make a fuss. I sit quietly and try to remember, or I retrace my steps. If it's really bad, I ask Ally. But I hate doing that too much—it makes me feel... incapable.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you use a smartphone or tablet? What do you use it for?</summary>

I use my phone—mostly for calls, some texts, and I check Facebook. I scroll through pictures of the grandkids or see what the cousins are up to.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever used any apps to remind you of things?</summary>

I think Ally's set some alarms for me before, but I don't know what app she used. I just hear the beeping and I know it's time for something.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When using apps, what makes them easy or difficult for you?</summary>

I don't like when things are too small to read, or when the buttons are in strange places. If it's clear and big and doesn't have too many steps, then I can manage. But if there are too many menus? Forget it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When texting or using app, you prefer to use voice control or touch control?</summary>

I use my finger most of the time, but if I could talk to it—like "Remind me to take my pill"—that'd be nice. As long as it understands me. Sometimes those voice things don't.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you want from your daily life?</summary>

Gentle reminders would be nice. Not pushy. Just something that pops up or says, "Don't forget your medicine." Or "Have you eaten?" And maybe something that helps me keep track of what I did today, so I don't feel so lost.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you not want?</summary>

I don't want anyone treating me like I'm useless. I may be forgetful, but I can still think. I don't want someone doing everything for me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there tasks you prefer to do on your own? What tasks would you rather someone help you with?</summary>

I like to pick out my own clothes, make my tea, write my little lists. Things like that. But I need help lifting heavy things or getting down the stairs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it be helpful to have gentle reminders for important things, like meals or medicine?</summary>

Yes, absolutely. But it has to be gentle—not nagging.

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What do you think about this kind of app?</summary>

I think that sounds lovely. Anything to keep me from feeling like a burden. I don't like relying on Ally for every little thing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would you like to try using something like this?</summary>

Yes, I'd try it—especially if it's simple to use and Ally helps set it up.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What would you want this app to do for you?</summary>

Remind me about my medicine. Tell me when it's time to eat. Help me remember appointments or family birthdays. And maybe keep a little list of what I've done each day so I can look back and feel less... forgetful.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

I'd worry it might be too complicated. Or that I'd mess something up by pressing the wrong button. I don't want it to beep at me too much or stress me out. And I'd want to know who can see what's in it—just me and Ally, hopefully.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

Oh, let's see now… if I were setting up that little app of yours, these are the things I'd want it to remind me about—nothing too fancy, just the basics to help me stay on track.

### Daily Reminders

- **Morning medicine** – around 9:00 AM, after I've had my tea.
- **Afternoon water reminder** – sometimes I forget to drink water unless someone tells me.
- **Evening medicine** – maybe 8:00 PM or so, before I start winding down.
- **Check if I've eaten** – just a gentle nudge around lunchtime and dinner. Something like, "Have you had your lunch yet?"
- **Bathroom reminder** – if I've been sitting too long, a gentle poke to move a bit or check in with my body.

### Weekly Tasks

- **Grocery day with Ally** – usually Saturday or Sunday. It could remind me the night before to get my shopping list ready.
- **Trash day** – I never remember when the bins go out anymore. The app could say "Put the bins out tonight."
- **Laundry day** – if Ally helps on certain days, I'd like to remember to gather my clothes or ask her for help.
- **Sunday call with family** – if we're trying to stay in touch more, that'd be nice to remember.

### Health Check Reminders

- **Doctor appointments** – sometimes Ally books them, and I forget until we're already late.
- **Breathing treatment or puffers** – not every day, but on the bad days when I need it, it could ask, "How's your breathing today?"
- **Kidney check-up schedule** – it's not often, but when it comes up, it's important I don't forget.

### Memory Support

- **"What did I do today?"** – A little note section that asks in the evening, "Want to write down something from today?" Might help me feel less lost.
- **Remind me where I put things** – Like if Ally logs that I left the keys by the bread box, it can say, "Your keys are by the bread box!"
