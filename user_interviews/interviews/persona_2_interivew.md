## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe what a normal day looks like for you?</summary>

Most days are pretty quiet. I usually wake up when John does, and he helps me with breakfast and gives me my medication. I might do a little gardening if the weather's nice, or watch a TV show. I sometimes message my friends or look at Facebook. In the afternoon, I'll either rest, make something simple to eat, or wait for John to come home. We eat dinner together and watch something on TV before bed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does anyone help you with your daily routine? If so, how do they assist you?</summary>

Yes, John helps a lot. He makes sure I take my medication and keeps track of appointments and other things. He usually writes things down or sets reminders on his phone for me. He's very patient.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you use anything to help you remember things, like notes, alarms, or reminders from people?</summary>

Yes, sometimes I write notes, and John uses his phone to set alarms or reminders. He also reminds me in person. I have a calendar too, but I forget to look at it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What things do you forget most often?</summary>

I forget what day it is, what I just talked about, or if I've eaten yet. Sometimes I forget if I've taken my medicine already, which worries me.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>Are there times when forgetting something causes problems or stress for you?</summary>

Yes, especially with medicine. I get nervous if I'm not sure whether I've taken it. I also get embarrassed if I repeat myself a lot when talking to people.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you sometimes feel confused or unsure about what's happening during the day?</summary>

Yes, especially if the routine changes. If something unexpected happens or I can't remember a plan, I feel a bit lost or anxious.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When you forget something, how do you usually handle it?</summary>

I usually ask John. Sometimes I try to retrace my steps or check my phone or calendar, but I get frustrated if I can't figure it out.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you use a smartphone or tablet? What do you use it for?</summary>

Yes, I use my phone. I use it mostly for texting, calling, Facebook, and looking at photos. Sometimes I check the weather or search something simple.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Have you ever used any apps to remind you of things?</summary>

John has set some alarms or reminders, but I don't use reminder apps myself unless he sets them up for me.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When using apps, what makes them easy or difficult for you?</summary>

If it's simple and clear, I can use it. If there are too many steps or buttons, I get confused or give up. I like when there are pictures or clear labels.

</details>

<details>
<summary>When texting or using app, you prefer to use voice control or touch control?</summary>

I mostly use touch, but sometimes voice is easier if I remember how to use it. John helps me with that.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you want from your daily life?</summary>

I'd like reminders for medicine, meals, and maybe when I have plans. I also appreciate when someone checks in on me if I seem off.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of help would you not want?</summary>

I don't want someone doing everything for me. I still like feeling useful.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there tasks you prefer to do on your own? What tasks would you rather someone help you with?</summary>

I like to water the plants, help with meals, and do little chores. I prefer help with remembering things, managing appointments, or anything that needs a lot of steps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it be helpful to have gentle reminders for important things, like meals or medicine?</summary>

Yes, definitely. Especially if they're not too loud or annoying.

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What do you think about this kind of app?</summary>

I think it sounds helpful, especially if it's easy to use.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would you like to try using something like this?</summary>

Yes, I'd be open to trying it, especially if John helps me set it up.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What would you want this app to do for you?</summary>

Remind me gently when it's time to take my medicine or eat. Maybe even show what I have planned today. I'd also like a little checkmark or something when I've done something already, so I don't keep guessing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

I'd worry that I might not remember how to use it. If it's too complicated, I might stop using it. I'd want it to be simple, with big buttons or even voice reminders. And not too many pop-ups.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

Hmm… if I were using an app like that, I think I'd want to set tasks that help me feel steady through the day, especially the ones I forget often. Here's what I'd probably set on it:

### Daily Routine Reminders

- **Take morning medicine** (maybe around 8 AM)
- **Eat breakfast** (right after meds)
- **Take afternoon medicine** (if I have any)
- **Eat lunch**
- **Check the calendar or today's plan** (mid-morning)
- **Drink water** (maybe every couple hours, since I forget)
- **Eat dinner**
- **Take evening medicine** (if I have it)
- **Start getting ready for bed** (like brushing teeth, maybe around 9 PM)

### Memory Support

- **"Did you take your medicine?" check-in** – something like a yes/no button
- **"Today's events"** – something I can tap to see if I have visitors or plans
- **Mark off completed tasks** – like checking off that I ate or took my pills

### Simple Chores I Can Still Do

- **Water the plants** (every 2–3 days)
- **Put laundry in** (maybe once a week, with John reminding me too)
- **Tidy up kitchen** (after meals, just a gentle nudge)

### Social Reminders

- **Message a friend** (once a week, just to stay connected)
- **Son visits?** – if my son's coming soon, it could remind me that morning so I don't get caught off guard

### Emotional & Health Check

- **A reminder to take a breath or rest** if I'm feeling overwhelmed
- **Maybe a small journal or "How are you feeling today?" button**, just with simple faces I could tap

If it's easy to see and I can just tap things when they're done, I think that would really help. And maybe John can set some of the reminders too so I don't have to remember to do that myself.
