## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe your daily caregiving routine?</summary>

My day starts early. I help my mom get up, take her medication, and make her breakfast. I usually check her oxygen levels if her breathing seems off. I try to leave notes or use sticky reminders before heading to work. I text or call her during lunch to check in. After work, I handle everything—dinner, laundry, cleaning, helping her get ready for bed. Most evenings are spent just trying to stay on top of household chaos.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you help the person you care for remember things, like medicine or appointments?</summary>

I use a paper calendar and sticky notes around the house. I also try to remind her verbally, especially in the morning and evening. She sometimes uses her phone's alarm for medication, but it doesn't always work well if she forgets what it's for.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are other family members involved in caregiving? If so, how do you coordinate?</summary>

Not really. Family visits on weekends sometimes, but I'm the one who does everything daily. I've asked for more help, but it hasn't really changed.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>What are the most difficult parts of your caregiving role?</summary>

The emotional exhaustion. She doesn't always recognize her memory problems, and it's frustrating repeating things or finding messes she forgot she made. The physical toll of cleaning, cooking, and managing her health—on top of working full-time—is just overwhelming.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there times when you feel anxious about their safety or well-being?</summary>

Constantly. I worry about her forgetting to turn off the stove or taking the wrong medicine. Sometimes I'm afraid to even leave the house for work.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do memory problems affect your own schedule or energy?</summary>

I lose hours redoing things—reminding her of tasks, cleaning up accidents or confusion, or calming her down when she gets agitated. I'm always mentally on alert. I don't sleep well, and it's hard to have energy for anything else.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you or your family member use phones or apps for health or reminders?</summary>

I do. She mostly just uses her phone for Facebook or calls. I've tried setting alarms or reminders for her, but if she doesn't understand them in the moment, they're not much help.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tech have you tried (if any) to assist with care?</summary>

Just phone alarms, calendar alerts, and medication apps (for me, not her). I looked into smart home tech, but we can't afford it, and she wouldn't be comfortable with too much change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes a digital tool easy or hard for you and them to use?</summary>

For me, it has to be fast and simple—I'm always multitasking. For her, big text, clear icons, and limited steps are key. Anything confusing makes her upset. If she clicks the wrong thing, she'll panic.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>In what areas do you wish you had more support as a caregiver?</summary>

I need help monitoring her daily when I'm not home. Also, someone to talk to—I'm completely isolated. More structure in her day would help both of us, honestly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it help if you could check in on their routine remotely?</summary>

Yes. If I could see that she took her meds or ate or just had a calm day, it would ease so much anxiety.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of features would make a memory-support app truly helpful for your situation?</summary>

Easy daily reminders that she can't accidentally delete
A shared caregiver dashboard I can access
Mood or wellness check-ins
Simple voice commands or alerts
Notifications if she misses something important
Emergency alerts if something goes wrong

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What features would be most useful to you personally?</summary>

Remote check-ins, reminders I can customize and monitor, and a way for her to check off tasks would be amazing. If it could also gently redirect her when she's confused (e.g., a voice that reminds her what time it is or what to do next), that would be a game-changer.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you feel about this kind of app?</summary>

Honestly? Relieved that something like this exists. I've felt completely alone trying to hold everything together. If the app actually works and doesn't confuse her, I'd be so grateful.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there anything you'd be worried about using or setting up?</summary>

Just how user-friendly it is. If it's too complicated or buggy, it'll stress both of us out more. Also, I need to trust that it won't mess up and make her more confused.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

Absolutely. I'd try anything at this point to help us both feel more stable and less overwhelmed.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

If I were setting up the app for my mom, I'd keep the tasks very simple, repetitive, and structured to match her routine and avoid confusing her. Here's a breakdown of the kinds of tasks I would schedule:

### Daily Routine Tasks (Repeated every day at the same time)

- **7:30 AM – Take morning medication**

  - Include a photo of her pill organizer and a short voice reminder like: "Good morning, it's time to take your pills now."

- **8:00 AM – Eat breakfast**

  - Prompt to check the kitchen and maybe suggest simple food options she likes (e.g., toast, cereal).

- **11:00 AM – Stretch or light movement**

  - Simple chair exercises for arthritis. Could use a short video or checklist.

- **12:30 PM – Eat lunch**

  - Remind her to check the fridge (I'll leave a labeled lunch container ahead of time).

- **2:00 PM – Hydration reminder**

  - A quick, friendly prompt: "Time to have a glass of water."

- **3:00 PM – Quiet activity**

  - Suggest something gentle, like looking through old photo albums, a craft box, or coloring pages. Something calming.

- **5:00 PM – Take afternoon medication**

  - Another pill reminder with a voice note: "Don't forget your afternoon pills. They're in the green slot today."

- **6:00 PM – Dinner time**

  - Prompt her to wait for me or heat up what I've left prepared.

- **8:00 PM – Evening breathing check-in**

  - Simple check: "How's your breathing? If you're short of breath, sit up straight and let Ally know."

- **9:00 PM – Take night medication and prepare for bed**
  - Gentle wind-down prompt. Maybe play calming music.

### Weekly Tasks (Scheduled on specific days)

- **Saturday 11:00 AM – Call with family**

  - Prompt her to check her phone or wait for a video call.

- **Sunday 3:00 PM – Short walk with Ally or a visitor**

  - If her health allows. A reminder to get ready and wear proper shoes/clothes.

- **Wednesday 2:00 PM – Garbage day prep**
  - Gentle reminder for her to let me know if anything needs to go out.

### Special Alerts or Reminders

- **"Don't use the stove alone" reminder**

  - Timed around meal prep hours, just in case she forgets.

- **Emergency contact button**

  - Easy one-tap access to call me or another relative.

- **Missed task alerts**
  - If she skips medication or doesn't interact with the app, I'd like a notification so I can call her or check in.
