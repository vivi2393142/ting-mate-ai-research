## Interview Execution Summary

### Current Behavior

<details>
<summary>Can you describe your daily caregiving routine?</summary>

I wake up early, usually around the same time as Mr. Chang—he's always up by 6 a.m. I prepare breakfast for both of us. After that, he usually makes his tea and watches TV for most of the day. I check in periodically, make sure he eats lunch, and handle dinner after my part-time shift at the store. I don't interfere too much with his routine unless something seems off or unsafe.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you help the person you care for remember things, like medicine or appointments?</summary>

He doesn't take many medications right now, but when he needs reminders, I usually just tell him directly. He doesn't like being "nagged," so I try to keep it casual or make it part of our regular chat during meals. Appointments are tricky—he doesn't like going to doctors, and only his daughter, Ms. Chang, can really convince him.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are other family members involved in caregiving? If so, how do you coordinate?</summary>

Yes, my sister-in-law (his daughter) is involved. She calls him every day and visits on weekends. We talk by phone occasionally if something important comes up—like if he's more confused than usual or needs something only she can address. We coordinate his medical care through her since he listens to her more.

</details>

### Challenges

<details>
<summary>What are the most difficult parts of your caregiving role?</summary>

It's hard when he repeats himself or gets confused and doesn't realize it. He gets defensive if we suggest he might be forgetting things. I have to stay patient without correcting him too much, which takes emotional energy.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there times when you feel anxious about their safety or well-being?</summary>

Yes, especially when I'm at work. I worry he might forget something on the stove or open the door to a stranger. So far nothing serious has happened, but I'm always a little on edge.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do memory problems affect your own schedule or energy?</summary>

They wear me down over time. It's not physically demanding, but emotionally, it's draining. I often feel like I have to do everything twice—once for him, then again to double-check. And I have less time and energy for myself.

</details>

### Tech Familiarity & UI Attitudes

<details>
<summary>Do you or your family member use phones or apps for health or reminders?</summary>

I don't use apps for caregiving specifically. Mr. Chang uses his phone for calls and voice messages, mostly with his daughter, but that's it. He's not open to learning new tech.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What types of tech have you tried (if any) to assist with care?</summary>

Not much—just calendar reminders on my own phone to track appointments or shopping. We haven't tried anything like smart devices or tracking tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What makes a digital tool easy or hard for you and them to use?</summary>

It needs to be extremely simple. If it has more than one button or screen, Mr. Chang won't touch it. For me, I can manage apps, but I don't want anything that takes a long time to set up or update every day. I need something that works quietly in the background.

</details>

### Needs

<details>
<summary>In what areas do you wish you had more support as a caregiver?</summary>

I wish I had help keeping track of his routine when I'm not home. Something to ease the mental burden of checking and double-checking things like meals, safety, and whether he's feeling okay.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Would it help if you could check in on their routine remotely?</summary>

Yes, especially during my work hours. Even just a little reassurance that everything is fine at home would ease my mind a lot.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of features would make a memory-support app truly helpful for your situation?</summary>

Voice reminders that sound like a family member
Simple yes/no check-ins that I can review
Alerts if he misses meals or doesn't respond
A way for his daughter to stay involved too—maybe share access
Not requiring Mr. Chang to push buttons or navigate screens

</details>

### App Introduction & Feedback

<details>
<summary>What features would be most useful to you personally?</summary>

Remote check-ins with simple confirmation ("Did he have breakfast?")
A log of what he did or didn't respond to
Gentle, pre-recorded reminders from a familiar voice
Weekend coordination features for his daughter

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you feel about this kind of app?</summary>

Honestly, it sounds promising—if it's truly simple and doesn't require much effort from Mr. Chang. I'd be more open if it helps me without making things harder for him.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is there anything you'd be worried about using or setting up?</summary>

Yes, I worry about the setup being complicated. Also, Mr. Chang might resist anything that feels like surveillance or "treatment." It has to feel natural—like part of his day, not something clinical.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What worries or questions would you have about using it?</summary>

Yes, as long as the setup is easy and it respects his independence. I'd probably ask his daughter to help introduce it—he listens to her more.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What tasks will you set on the app?</summary>

If I were setting up tasks on the app for Mr. Chang, I'd keep it very simple and focused on maintaining his daily routine and safety, while respecting his independence. Here's what I would start with:

### Daily Tasks (Routine-Based Reminders)

#### Morning

- **6:30 a.m. – "Time for your tea."**
  - Gentle voice reminder (maybe from his daughter) to keep his routine consistent.
- **8:00 a.m. – "Did you eat breakfast?"**
  - Simple yes/no check-in so I can see if he's on track.

#### Midday

- **12:00 p.m. – "Lunch time."**
  - Reminder, especially useful when I'm not home.
- **12:30 p.m. – "Did you take your walk or stretch a bit?"**
  - Encouragement to move around a little; he often forgets.

#### Evening

- **5:30 p.m. – "Dinner will be ready soon."**
  - To help him mentally prepare, so he doesn't snack and skip meals.
- **7:30 p.m. – "Turn off the stove/lights if you're not using them."**
  - Gentle safety check to avoid forgetful accidents.

### Weekly Tasks (Family Coordination)

- **Friday Afternoon – "Your daughter is visiting tomorrow."**
  - He forgets and gets flustered when surprised. This helps him prepare.
- **Sunday – "Check if anything needs to be restocked (tea, snacks, meds)."**
  - Gives me or his daughter a heads-up on what to bring or buy.

### Check-ins / Safety Alerts

- **If he doesn't confirm a meal or task twice in a row**, I'd like to be notified (via the app or a quiet alert), so I can call or check in with him.

### Voice & Tone

- **I would use pre-recorded reminders in his daughter's voice** for sensitive or personal messages. He responds better to her and is more likely to listen.
