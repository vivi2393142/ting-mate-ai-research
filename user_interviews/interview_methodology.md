# Interview Methodology

This folder documents how GPT-based personas were used to simulate user interviews for early-stage design research.

## Purpose

Real interviews with memory-impaired individuals can be difficult due to recruitment challenges, ethical concerns, and communication barriers. To address this, simulated personas were used to explore user needs and preferences without involving real participants. This also allowed for early testing of how large language models can support user research in hard-to-reach contexts.

## Interview Design

Each persona answered a tailored questionnaire written to reflect realistic experiences. There were two sets of questions: one for care receivers and one for caregivers. Topics included:

- Daily tasks and challenges
- Memory issues and coping strategies
- Technology habits and comfort levels
- Reactions to a reminder or support app
- Preferences for how help is offered

Interviews were conducted in multi-turn dialogue with each persona. Answers were reviewed to check for coherence with persona profiles and to gather design insights.

## Analysis

Responses were manually reviewed to identify common patterns, unmet needs, and potential feature ideas. The focus was on understanding how memory support apps could fit into real caregiving situations. Key findings were later summarized to guide design.
